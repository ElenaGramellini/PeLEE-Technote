\label{sec:nueselection:inclusive}

The aim of the inclusive charged-current electron neutrino selection is to select electron neutrinos independently of their final state and energy. The selection efficiency is approximately 20\%, leading to 250-300 electron neutrino's in the Run 1-4 data-set. The purity without CRT is $\approx 35-40\%$ and with CRT $\approx 45-50\%$.

\subsubsection{Pre-selection}
The selection builds on top of the SliceID (\cref{sec:sliceID}). At first the following cuts are applied:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Reconstructed, space-charge corrected vertex inside a fiducial volume of \SI{10}{\cm} in $x$ and $y$ and $[ \SI{20}{\cm}, \SI{50}{\cm}]$ in $z$.
    \item Topological score above 0.15
    \item CosmicIP $>$ $\SI{15}{\cm}$
    \item slclustfrac $>$ 0.4
    \item An electron candidate shower
\end{itemize}
here, an electron candidate shower is defined as a particle with a trackscore below 0.3, and hits on all three planes. Furthermore, a minimum calorimeric energy of \SI{75}{\MeV} is required. 

At this stage, the efficiency of the selection is 46\% for $\nu_e$ CC events inside the fiducial volume. This is equivalent to 618 events per \SI{10.1e20}{POT}. The number of LEE signal events passing is approximately 30 per \SI{10.1e20}{POT}. The purity at this stage is 3.0\% and the Data/MC ratio is 0.91.

\cref{fig:pre_vtx,fig:pre_shower_E_pdg} show the agreement in the vertex location and kinematics of the electron candidate shower at this stage of the selection.

\subsubsection{Electron Identification}
After the pre-selection, the object that is tagged as electron candidate is still not an neutrino electron in the dominant fraction of events. The ratio photons to electrons is approximately 20 to 1 and photon-electron separation is therefore the main objective of electron identification. The identification is done using a boosted decision tree, trained on variables that belong to the particle. Those variables are:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Shower vertex distance.
    \item Shower d$E$/d$x$ at the start of the shower:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item On the collection plane only.
        \item Weighted mean over the 3 planes.
        \item Collection plane, but shifted by \SI{1}{\cm}. 
    \end{itemize}
    \item Shower Moliere radius.
    \item Second shower distance and number of hits on the collection plane.
    \item Number of subclusters in the shower.
    \item ismerged: checks if a proton is merged in the start of the shower.
\end{enumerate}

The three distributions of the variables used to characterise the d$E$/d$x$ at the start of the shower are given in \cref{fig:e_cand_dedx}. The response of the BDT is shown in the right panel of \cref{fig:e_cand_dist}.

The middle panel combines all three planes, leading to a smaller peak at 0 in cases where there are few hits on the collection plane. The plane on the right uses the collection plane but leaves a \SI{1}{\cm} gap, which is beneficial when vertex activity is merged into the electron shower.}

\subsubsection{Other Daughters Identification}

%\textcolor{blue}{(comment by David) This section is not too clear. Is this BDT score computed per PFParticle, for all %PFParticles that are not the electron candidate? What do you mean when you say that pions are not used? PFParticles from %nue slices are classified as signal-like, PFParticles from numu/NC events are background like, and pions from all events %are not classified at all?}

Apart of the electron candidate particle, there are other particles in the slice. In this section we study each of those PFParticles separately, except the electron candidate shower described in the previous section. Particle by particle a BDT is used to split the particle into two categories:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Positive if the particle is backtracked to a proton or a split-off part of the electron.
    \item Negative if the particle is backtracked to cosmic overlay or a simulated muon. 
\end{enumerate}
The philosophy behind this is that we want to reject events which contain a particle which is overlay or muon like. On the other hand, particles that are backtracked to protons or electron bits are allowed and should not lead to the rejection of the event.
\par The more complicated situation arises when pions are present. Charged pions should be allowed in a $\nu_e$ CC search, but the mis-identification rate between charged pions and muons is large in this detector type. Photons coming from neutral pions, apart of the electron shower candidate, can be part of the $\nu_e$ CC event, but can also help to reduce the NC $\pi^0$ backgrounds. It was chosen therefore to give them a neutral label. 

The input variables of the BDT are:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item trk\_llr\_pid\_score
    \item trk\_distance
    \item trk\_score
    \item The generation of the particle: primary daughter of the neutrino or secondary.
    \item Has the particle a shower or a track as daughter?
\end{enumerate}
The three most important distributions of the variables used are given in \cref{fig:pre_daughter_1}. The response of the BDT is shown in \cref{fig:pre_daughter_score}.

\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Event Selection}
The final event classification build on top of the particle identification performed in the two previous sections. THe dominating variable is the electron identification response but the full list of variables is, in sequence of importance:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Electron BDT response
    \item Lowest BDT response of the other daughter BDT. \textcolor{blue}{(David) Lowest means the score for the least nue-like PFParticle? What happens if no additional PFParticle is present?}
    \item contained\_fraction
    \item Number of showers
    \item hits\_ratio
    \item Mean BDT response of the other daughter BDT \textcolor{blue}{(David) If there are two PFParticles in addition to the electron candidate, this quantity is the average of their BDT response. What happens if there are no additional PFParticles?}
    \item Number of particles away from the vertex. \textcolor{blue}{(David) Away from the vertex means how many cm?}
\end{enumerate}
The response of the event classification is given in the left panel \cref{fig:pre_event_score}. After the selection, the efficiency is 21\%, corresponding to 280 electron neutrino's in the Run 1-4 data-set. The distribution of the reconstructed electron energy is given in the right panel of \cref{fig:pre_event_score}. \cref{fig:nueccinc_eff} documents the efficiency of the SliceID, pre-selection and final inclusive selection for the three final state categories.
