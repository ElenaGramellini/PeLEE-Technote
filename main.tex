\abstract{The analysis presented in this note uses data from the MicroBooNE Experiment to measure  $\nu_e$ interactions from the Booster Neutrino Beamline using the Pandora reconstruction framework. Our goal is addressing the nature of the anomalous excess of low-energy events with EM activity in the final state as recorded by the MiniBooNE experiment. In this document, we outline the analysis strategy, focusing on the reconstruction and event selections performed, the evaluation of systematics associated to detector, flux, and neutrino-interaction modeling, and the expected sensitivity to the MB-$\nu_e$ LEE model utilizing the available BNB dataset of 10.1$\times 10^{20}$ POT. }

\section{$\nu_e$ Selections}
\label{sec:nueselection}
\par This section presents the three $\nu_e$ selections which comprise the analysis. We start with describing the common variables and tools leveraged by all $\nu_e$ selections in section~\ref{sec:nueselection:variables}. Next, the \npsel (sec.~\ref{sec:nueselection:1eNp}) and \zpsel (sec.~\ref{sec:nueselection:1e0p}) channel selections are presented, starting with a description of where the two selections branch off~\ref{sec:nueselection:inputs}. Finally, the $\nu_e$ inclusive selection is presented in~\ref{sec:nueselection:inclusive}.

\subsection{Input to \npsel and \zpsel and channel orthogonality \textcolor{green}{David + Sophie P.R. Elena} }
\label{sec:nueselection:inputs}

The 1$e$N$p$ and 1$e$0$p$ selections rely on a common pre-selection which requires the presence of at least one reconstructed and contained EM shower (figure~\ref{fig:nue:presel:nshower}) with reconstructed energy above 70 MeV (figure~\ref{fig:nue:presel:shrenergy}). This second cut applies as a Michel-electron veto, as the majority of events which do not pass this cut are associated to cosmic or $\nu_{\mu}$ induced $\mu \rightarrow e$ Michel electrons. The two selections are subsequently split: we require the presence of at least one proton candidate for the N$p$ channel and the absence of proton candidates the 0$p$ channel. Reconstructed tracks (track-shower score $> 0.5$) are defined as proton-candidates if they are fully contained,  have a \texttt{trkpid} score $< 0$ \textcolor{blue}{I don;t think we've defined that trackpid<0 is protons, we should in a previous paragraph}, and a value of \texttt{tksh\_angle} $> -0.9$. The second condition requires that the track be proton-like according to the PID tool~\ref{subsec:loglikelihoodpid}, while the third excludes tracks reconstructed back-to-back to the electron candidate, generally due to mis-reconstruction. For events with more than one reconstructed track, these requirements are applied on the longest track.

\par The efficiencies of the 1$e$N$p$ and 1$e$0$p$ channels at the point where the selections diverge are shown in figure~\ref{fig:nue:presel:eff}. Efficiencies are presented as a function of true neutrino energy (fig.~\ref{fig:nue:presel:eff:nu}), proton KE (fig.~\ref{fig:nue:presel:eff:proton}), and electron energy (fig.~\ref{fig:nue:presel:eff:elec}). Each plot shows in black the efficiency for the common pre-selection (before requirements on protons are imposed) relative to all intrinsic $\nu_e$ events. The efficiencies for the  1$e$N$p$ and 1$e$0$p$ selections relative to true N$p$ and 0$p$ events are shown in blue and red respectively.
Shaded histograms in red and blue show the stacked truth-level distributions for N$p$ and 0$p$ events for the variables being plotted. It is important to observe that the reconstruction efficiency for 1$e$N$p$ events is significantly lower then that of 1$e$0$p$ events at this pre-selection stage. This is caused by the additional requirement of the presence of a proton-like track in the final state. The strong energy dependence for the efficiency in tagging protons is shown in figure~\ref{fig:nue:presel:eff:proton}. While requiring the presence of a final-state proton lowers the efficiency, this requirement has a significant impact on the selection's ultimate purity.

\subsection{\npsel Channel \textcolor{green}{David + Giuseppe ... PR Elena}}
\label{sec:nueselection:1eNp}

The 1$e$N$p$ channel is the most sensitive to the MiniBooNE eLEE signal as it contains a large fraction of the signal events and allows for selection requirements based both on showers and tracks. Since $\nu_e$ charge-current interactions are O(1\%) in the BNB and a large cosmic background is present, a high-purity selection is needed to achieve a sizeable signal sensitivity; the necessary trade-off is that the final signal efficiency will be low.

The section is organized as follows. We first define a set of minimal requirements (``preselection") to obtain a high statistics sample used to monitor the data-MC agreement of the selection variables;
the events at the preselection stage are dominated by cosmic and neutrino backgrounds. We then define two alternative selections, one based on a simple box-cut approach and one on boosted decision trees (BDT); the BDT approach is expected to be the most sensitive, while box-cuts provide a robust reference selection. Finally, we compare all presented selections in terms for their signal efficiency and purity.

\subsubsection{Preselection}

At preselection stage we apply the minimum set of requirements so that all selection variables can be defined, plus the containment and a minimum shower energy to reject Michel electrons (Table~\ref{tab:1eNp:presel}).

\begin{table}[h!]
\centering
\setlength{\tabcolsep}{10pt}
\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.25}
 \begin{tabular}{| c | c |} 
 \hline
 Cut goal & Cut definition \\
 \hline\hline

 \hline
\multirow{2}{*}{Signal~topology} & n\_tracks\_contained $>$ 0 \\
 & n\_showers\_contained $>$ 0 \\
 \hline
Containment & contained\_fraction $>$ 0.9 \\
 \hline
Michel rejection & shr\_energy\_tot\_cali $>$ 0.07 GeV \\
 \hline
 \end{tabular}
 \caption{\label{tab:1eNp:presel} Preselection requirements for the \npsel selection.}
\end{table}

The relative fraction of EXT events at this stage is roughly 25\%, so we can look at all selection variables in data and MC in a neutrino-dominated sample with the open Run1 and Run3 data sets. We typically see very good agreement, which rules out major problems related to POT-scaling, detector modeling, inclusive cross-section. \emph{The main exception are dEdx variables that show some tension due to the incomplete calibration (\textcolor{blue}{see figure [add dedx figure]} and  Sec.~\ref{sec:controls:pi0} for more details) to be finalized the near future.} The full list of plots can be found in Appendix~\ref{sec:datamc:plots}. Figure~\ref{fig:1eNp:prsel} shows the level of agreement for the reconstructed neutrino energy variable.

\end{center}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Box-cuts}

On top of preselection requirements, we define a robust selection based on box cuts targeting high $\nu_e$ purity, especially at lower energy.
We present here cuts in different categories according to the background they primarily suppress; however,  the following description should be regarded as a simplification since some variables are effective against multiple backgrounds.


The requirement of a proton-like track is a very effective tool for cosmic rejection: this requirement rejects more than 90\% of the cosmics that pass pre-selection. We aim at rejecting more cosmic-induced events by requiring a large distance of the neutrino vertex from clear cosmic tracks. 

The next goal is to suppress events from $\nu_\mu$ charged current interactions; for this purpose, we impose tight quality requirements on the shower object and we require the shower hits to be the dominant contribution in the slice. These requirements rely on several variables aiming at separating EM showers from single-particle tracks, i.e. shr\_score, shrmoliereavg, trkfit, subcluster. 

At this stage, most of the selected events contain neutrino-induced electromagnetic activity. Thus, the main background left to tackle is  $\pi^0$ events. For $\pi^0$ rejection, we employ a series of requirements based on the different topology and energy deposition of electrons and photons. We first require the presence of only one shower-like PFParticle starting at a short distance from the track start in the event. Then, we require that the energy loss at the start of the electron shower is be compatible with a single MIP. Many dEdx variable definitions are possible, and information from all TPC planes can be used. However, due to detector and reconstruction limitations, there is not a single definition that provides a sharp separation between electrons and photons. In order to obtain a good background rejection without large efficiency losses, we choose to apply a loose MIP cut on two different dEdx definitions (described in Sec.~\ref{sec:nueselection:variables}). The loose MIP requirement enforces that there is at least one hit in the collection plane in the probed range, and that the dEdx is not consistent with two or more MIPs in any plane. Finally, the single shower requirement is reinforced with a 2nd shower veto based on clusters in the collection plane that are not matched to any PFParticle.

The last cut aims at rejecting misreconstructed events and requires that the track and shower are not aligned. For reference, the full list of cuts is in Table~\ref{tab:1eNp:boxcut}.

The resulting reconstructed \nue energy after the BDT selection is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:1eNp:box:RUN1}. Two events are found in the available $4.07E19$ POT dataset from Run1, with an expectation of 2.3 from the simulation. Both events appear to be good $\nu_e$ candidates (consistent with the level of purity expected), and are reconstructed with $\sim 1.1$ GeV of energy

\end{figure}

\subsubsection{BDT}

Alternatively to the box cut approach, a selection based on Boosted Decision Tree (BDT) algorithms has been developed. This selection is expected to be the most sensitive to low-energy \nue events since BDTs are able to learn additional information from the data and return a response variable that is highly discriminating between signal and background. 

\emph{While the development of the BDT selection is fairly advanced, a few steps are needed before it is finalized. Current limitations are mainly related to the limited size of the samples that are available for training and to the ongoing calibration of the dEdx variables used in the BDT. The limited sample size can lead to overtraining and suboptimal performance, while the missing calibration can induce small data-MC disagreements.} 

Because of these limitations, we deemed safer to consider only events that pass a loose set of cuts (Table~\ref{tab:1eNp:loosecut}) intended to reject events where one or more variables is clearly inconsistent with $\nu_e$ CC interactions. The loose cuts are applied on top the of the preselection both before the BDT training and before the application of the BDT in the analysis. This selection enhances the relative population of $\nu_e$ CC in the BNB overlay sample from about 1\% to more than 25\% (Fig.~\ref{fig:1eNp:loosesel}). \emph{In the final implementation of the BDT selection, the loose selection cuts may be revisited or removed}.

\end{figure}

Two BDTs are trained separately to reject backgrounds with and without $\pi^0$ in the final state. The same set of training variables is used in the two BDTs, corresponding to the list of variables used in the box-cut selection. The BDT training is able to figure out which variables are most important for each background. Figure~\ref{ffig:1eNp:bdt:var} shows that shower quality variables (e.g. shr\_score, trkfit, subcluster) have higher ranking for the non-$\pi^0$ BDT, while variables such as tksh\_distance and the shower dEdx have higher importance for the $\pi^0$-BDT. It is interesting to note that the most discriminating variable in both cases is shrmoliereavg, since it can be useful to discriminate both muons in $\nu_\mu$ events (low values) and merged showers in $\pi^0$ events (large values).

The resulting response in Run1 open data are shown in Figures~\ref{fig:1eNp:bdt:nonpi0} and \ref{fig:1eNp:bdt:pi0} for the non-$\pi^0$ and $\pi^0$ BDT, respectively. The left panel shows the full response, while the right one zooms in in the high BDT score region and shows the signal enhancement in the bin with response $>$ 0.99. We cut separately on the output of the two BDTs, requiring the $\pi^0$ and non-$\pi^0$ responses to be greater than 0.995 and 0.9984, respectively. The resulting reconstructed \nue energy after the BDT selection is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:1eNp:bdt:RUN1}.

\subsubsection{Performance of \npsel selections}

Figure~\ref{fig:1eNp:effpur:RUN1} shows the efficiency of the \npsel selections as a function of the neutrino energy and reports the corresponding intrinsic \npsel purity in the reconstructed energy range [0.2, 1.0] \si{\GeV}. The efficiency is already low at preselection level, especially for neutrino energies below 0.8 \si{\GeV}. This demonstrates how challenging it is to properly identify and reconstruct such events. The loose cuts then are able to improve the purity by one order of magnitude at the price of a 50\% reduction in efficiency. The BDT (box cut) selection then further improve the purity by a factor 7.4 (6.6) with a $\sim$30\% (50\%) reduction in efficiency. With the full 10.1e20 POT dataset, the expected number of MiniBooNE LEE signal events identified with the box cut selection is about 8, and increase to almost 11 with the BDT selection.

\emph{Figures~\ref{fig:1eNp:box:RUN1} and \ref{fig:1eNp:bdt:RUN1} show that the background to the \npsel events is in large fraction constituted by single events with large weight. This due to the relatively small size of the inclusive BNB sample. Note instead that the $\pi^0$ backgrounds are smoother since they come from larger dedicated samples. We are currently processing the additional background samples just produced by the collaboration. We thus plan to revisit the box cut and BDT selections after such samples will become available and after a residual calibration is applied to the dEdx variables.}

\subsection{1$e$0$p$0$\pi$ Channel \textcolor{green}{Sophie, Ivan ... PR Elena}}
\label{sec:nueselection:1e0p}

The \zpsel topology complements the \npsel topology as it is a part of the signal that MiniBooNE measured. The MiniBooNE signal is defined as 1eXp0$\pi$, which is the sum of the 1eNp0$\pi$ and 1e0p0$\pi$ channels. This means that including the \zpsel topology makes it possible for MicroBooNE to identify the full range of event topologies observed by MiniBooNE.    

The \zpsel channel can also be used to constrain uncertainties associated with the \npsel selection.  In particular, it can be used to constrain uncertainties associated with low energy protons, such as the modeling of the proton multiplicity and kinematics produced by neutrino interactions, as well as their reconstruction efficiencies.  This selection is very sensitive to the neutrino interaction modeling, which makes it a useful way to constrain these systematics with data.  In MCC8, there were twice as many events in this channel as in MCC9, including half of the  electron neutrinos below 0.8 GeV.

Since the \zpsel selection that will be described in this section is fully orthogonal to the \npsel selection, we can use it to constrain systematic uncertainties in the \npsel sample by allowing for migrations in a simultaneous fit. \emph{This will be described in section \ref{sec:1e0pconstraint}}.

\subsubsection{Tools Unique to 0p Selection}

%The \npsel sample is able to constrain systematic uncertainties in the \npsel sample because it is fully orthogonal with the \npsel selection by construction.  This will allow migrations in a simultaneous fit, as described in section \textcolor{blue}{XX}.  

The \zpsel selection allows us to recover $\nu_e$ signal events without visible protons.  The efficiency of this selection can be increased by using track-shower merging to recover \zpsel events that have been mis-reconstructed.

%\textcolor{blue}{ \st{These events are typically discarded immediately in the 1eNp selection, either by a cut on the angle between the track and the shower, or the track PID} In some sense, rightfully so: if the problem is shower mis-Reco, then the \npsel shouldnt catch them -- Elena}.  
The track-shower merging tool is a processing step 
%specific to \npsel workflow 
which is designed to recover events where the EM activity is split into a shower and one, or more, tracks. This occurs frequently when the shower trunk is mis-reconstructed as a track. To perform this recovery, we consider the most energetic shower and all of the tracks in the slice.  In case of multiple tracks, we select the track that best aligns with the shower by calculating the track with the angle that best matches the shower direction. In case of only one reconstructed track, the track is selected by default. We then calculate the distance between the start point of the shower and either ends of the selected track, and the smallest of these two values is stored as the  \emph{merge\_bestdist} variable.  We recover an event that fails the \npsel selection cuts at either the shower-track angle or track PID stage if the event has one contained track and one contained shower where \emph{merge\_bestdist} is less than 2 cm. As of December 20th, this corresponded to a 20\% increase in selected \zpsel events.


\subsubsection{Pre-selection}
Similarly to the \npsel workflow, a minimum set of pre-selection requirements are defined for the \zpsel selection.  The pre-selection requires that the all selection variables are defined, and all potential \zpsel events, including those included with track-shower merging are included %\textcolor{blue}{I don't think I understand this point on the 1eNp events... if we write it like this, the channels don't look orthogonal: I thought this preselection was after the splitting between Np and 0p pre-selections}.  
%Response: This is a typo.  I meant that we want to include the 0p events in the pre-selection, including the ones we might recover with shower merging. 
The pre-selection also includes a cut on the shower energy to remove decay electrons from cosmic muons. 
The \zpsel pre-selection is summarized in table \ref{tab:1e0p:presel}. Similarly to in the \npsel channel, we developed both a box cut and a BDT selection for \zpsel events after this pre-selection.

\subsubsection{Box cut selection}

A box cut selection has been developed to select \zpsel events. The selection cuts are designed to target the main backgrounds.  The fiducial volume from the CC inclusive analysis \cite{bib:numuCCincl} has been implemented to reduce the backgrounds associated with dirt and single showers entering the fiducial volume.   Cosmic rejection includes the addition of cuts on CRT variables and on CosmicIP.  In order to remove muon neutrino and non-showering backgrounds, cuts on the shower profile and the number of sub-clusters in the shower are applied.  A second shower search for hits on the Y plane is used to remove events where the second shower of a $\pi^{0}$ may have initially been missed.  dE/dx is also used to remove $\pi^{0}$ backgrounds.  Two calculations are used, one which looks at the first 2 cm of the shower, and one which starts the calculation after 1 cm so that any hits from a low energy proton that may have been merged with the shower are not included in the calculation.

The \zpsel box cuts are summarized in table \ref{tab:1e0p:cutbased}.

%%%shr_energy_tot_cali: Do you cut twice on this? Once in pre-selection and one here? They have differernt values (0.07 in pre-sel,  0.1 here).
%Response: Yes, in the box cuts I am cutting more strictly on this variable than in the pre-selection, or in the loose cuts that I use to train the BDT. I want to revisit this when optimizing the selection, and do not plan for the cut to stay here.

The reconstructed energy distribution after this selection is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:1e0p:cutbased:RUN3}.  \emph{Note that this plot uses the new Genie model, but the cuts have not yet been optimized for the new MC -- an improvement currently in the works.  This selection predicts 9.8 true \zpsel events in the full data set and is 27\% pure in Run 3 for electron neutrinos and the LEE.  This selection will be tuned and the work expanded to include Run 1.}

\subsubsection{BDT}

A selection has also been developed by training a BDT for the \zpsel events, with a similar method to the one used by the \npsel analysis.  At this stage the BDT has only been trained for Run 3 events, and includes a cut on the CRT variables before training to remove cosmic backgrounds.  \emph{This work will be expanded to include Run 1.}

The BDT is trained on a loose selection of \zpsel events, which includes the pre-selection cuts as well as several additional requirements that comprise a ``loose selection" to focus on identifying electron neutrinos, summarized in \ref{tab:1e0p:loosecut}.

 \hline
 \end{tabular}
 \caption{\label{tab:1e0p:loosecut} Loose cut requirements for the \zpsel BDT selection.}
\end{table}


Note that even this initial selection is somewhat strict, resulting in a drop of overall electron neutrino efficiency.
\emph{This is an initial study of the BDT performance. It may be possible to loosen these cuts and regain efficiency without compromising the BDT selection performance. At this stage, a single BDT which tries to separate all backgrounds from electron neutrino signals has been trained for this selection.  Performance may be improved by using multiple BDTs which are trained for specific background topologies as done in the \npsel selection. }

The BDT inputs are for the most part the same variables as those used in the box cuts.  In the BDT, however, the information from all three planes is used, while it was not always found to improve the performance of the box cuts.   More information from the second shower search is also included in the BDT, such as the distance from the vertex to the second shower, and the angle between the second shower and the initial shower. The full list of variables used to train the \zpsel BDT is: shrmoliererms, shrmoliereavg, shr\_score, CosmicIP, subcluster, secondshower\_(U,V,Y)\_nhit, secondshower\_(U,V,Y)\_vtxdist, secondshower\_(U,V,Y)\_dot, anglediff\_(U,V,Y), shr\_tkfit\_2cm\_dedx\_(U,V,Y), shr\_tkfit\_gap10\_dedx\_(U,V,Y), trkfit, and hits\_ratio. Plot ~\ref{fig:1e0p:bdtvars:RUN3} shows the relative importance of each of these variables in the BDT.  The variables for which information from all three planes is used in the BDT are combined into one variable labeled ``ALL" in this plot.

The final BDT selection is the loose cuts defined in Table~\ref{tab:1e0p:loosecut} with the addition of this cut on the BDT response. 
%This is the selection of events that is used to train the BDT, and these cuts are also applied before cutting on the BDT response for the BDT selection.

This selection predicts 10 true \zpsel events in the full data set, and is 49\% pure in Run 3 for electron neutrinos and the LEE from 0-2 GeV in reconstructed neutrino energy.  This selection is 44\% pure in the low energy range from 0.2-1 GeV reconstructed neutrino energy.

\section{Systematics \textcolor{red}{Maya, Nicolo, Sebastien}}
\label{sec:systematics}

Our selections are subject to some level of uncertainty, both statistical and systematic. The systematic uncertainties are associated to the level of precision of the model used in the \textcolor{blue}{simulation of neutrino interactions \st{reconstruction}} (GENIE), knowledge of the neutrino beam (flux), and mis-modeling of the detector response (detector systematics). These systematic uncertainties can be calculated for many parameters of the models and measured variables that we use to reconstruct our sample

\textcolor{blue}{When treating systematic uncertainties, one wishes to take into account correlations between different bins of the distribution of a given reconstructed variable.} For each uncertainty, a covariance matrix \textcolor{blue}{correlating the variation in the measured number of events between two bins is calculated \st{of its effect on a given distribution is obtained}}. Two approaches are followed to obtain the covariance matrix, depending on the type of uncertainty: unisim or multisim.

Unisim means that a single variation of a given analysis input parameter is performed according to its uncertainty. The difference in the number of selected events between this variation and the central value is taken as the uncertainty in that number of events.

In the multisim procedure, several variations of a given analysis input parameter are performed. These are called universes. These different variations are obtained from a different sampling of the input parameter, which is varied within its uncertainty. This approach allows to preserve correlations in the various bins of the distributions of selected events. The covariance matrix can then be obtained as

\begin{equation}
    E_{ij}^{sys} = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{k}^N (N_i^{CV} - N_i^k)(N_j^{CV} - N_j^k) ,
\end{equation}

where $N$ is the total number of universes, $N_i^k$ is the value in the
$i$-th bin of the $k$-th universe and $N_i^{CV}$ is that of the central value. We utilized the SBNfit framework~\cite{bib:bib:sbnfit20437} to construct the covariance matrices and the associated correlation matrices for our selection.

\subsection{Detector Systematics \textcolor{green}{David}}
Details on MicroBooNE's approach to handling detector systematics can be found in~\cite{bib:detsyssupportnote}. To assess detector systematic uncertainties in the eLEE analysis, the following detector variations samples are used:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Waveform variations in the examined variables ($x$, $yz$, $\theta_{XZ}$, $\theta_{YZ}$, $dE/dx$). Samples are available for the $x$, $yz$, and angular wire-modification variations. These detector variations are constructed by profiling reconstructed hit variables of charge, amplitude and width as a function of the mentioned variables with data-driven samples, and re-scaling the simulation by the difference between data and simulation. By doing this, the samples cover the difference between data and simulation. 
    \item Light response variations to estimate the light yield (LY) simulation uncertainty. Four variations are envisioned: (1) 10\% uniform and (2) 25\% uniform drop in LY to account for mis-modeling of the absolute LY in the detector. These samples are partially available. (3) 120 cm (compared to the simulation's 60 cm) Rayleigh scattering length and (4) 8 meter light attenuation length to account for drift-distance dependent mis-modeling. These samples are currently unavailable.
    \item Unisim for Space Charge Effects uncertainty. Currently not available.
\end{enumerate}
\par Detector systematics samples are generated as \emph{uni-sim} variations, meaning that, for each detector effect, a given MC event is re-simulated once with a change to a detector modeling parameter. This produces a new simulation of the same underlying neutrino interactions, which can be used to measure the impact of the detector effect being studied on efficiencies, reconstructed variables, and event pass-rates.
\par In the context of a sensitivity calculation, detector systematics unisims can be used to calculate a covariance matrix for selected event rates in each bin used in the sensitivity calculation. This covariance is then added to the total uncertainty matrix. The main drawback of this approach is the fact that the excursion in the number of measured events in a bin computed from a single variation is taken as the 1$\sigma$ excursion for the error estimation.
\par Below, simple comparisons of distributions relevant to the analysis under different detector variation samples are shown, but the full inclusion of detector systematics in the sensitivity calculation has not been performed. For calorimetric variables such as electron d$E$/d$x$ and $\pi^0$ mass some clear differences, such as shifts in energy scale, are visible, though contained to within a few percent. These initial comparisons are promising in that they seem to suggest a relatively minor impact to the analysis from detector systematics.

\subsection{Flux Uncertainties \textcolor{green}{Maya}}
The flux \textcolor{blue}{model} and \textcolor{blue}{its} uncertainties for MCC9~\cite{bib:fluxmcc9,bib:fluxtechnote} are largely the same as MCC8~\cite{bib:fluxtechnote}. We use the multisim technique to estimate the flux uncertainties. The various sources of uncertainties are taken as independent and are varied individually around the central value. They are listed in Table~\ref{tab:fluxsyst} along the number of universes considered for each. The fractional covariance matrix and correlation matrix for the 1eNp selection are presented in Figure~\ref{fig:fluxmatrices} which amount to 2\% in flux uncertainties. Meanwhile, Figure~\ref{fig:fluxsystvars} displays the effects of reweighting central value in each universe of an individual parameter of flux.

\subsection{Neutrino Interaction Modeling Uncertainties \textcolor{green}{Maya/Sebastien}}
We use genie event reweighting framework with the standard reweighting parameters, also known as "knobs", to model the neutrino cross section and final states uncertainties. Document~\cite{bib:geniesupportnote} describes the GENIE cross-section model, recommended central-value tune, and the recommended uncertainties for MCC9 analyses. 

The updated Genie central value tune is guided on fits to the T2K data which increase the MA CCQE and scale up the MEC normalization.

A total of 55 sources of uncertainties are considered. The majority of them, 49, are varied in a multisim way around the updated Genie central value tune. Their variations are simultaneous to take into account their correlations. This simultaneous variation is given the name All\_Genie. They are listed in Table~\ref{tab:AllGenie}. The variations of the remaining six sources cover the full range of the parameter values: they are varied from 0 to 1. Table~\ref{tab:geniesyst} lists the uncertainties that are used in the analysis and the number of universes investigated.

\textit{Note on the cross section systematics: The genie systematics is currently still under investigation. 
As mentioned above, the cross sections variations are thrown around the tuned genie central value and therefore already have the tuned central value weight folded in. 
Meanwhile, the default central value has to be multiplied with the genie central value tune weight to update it to the new cv value. 
We have to properly account for the Genie tuned central value that is already folded in into the Genie cross section weights so that the shift between the value in each universe of a variation and 
the central value in a bin is calculated correctly for systematics.
We observed a few number of large weights in the XSecShape\_CCMEC\_Genie knob which is also associated with a large weights for the Genie central value tune. Due to these large weights and other issues that currently not understood yet, the procedure to correct out the Genie tuned central value cause the genie cross section weights to not be centered around the central value, for example in RPA\_CCQE\_Genie variations (see Figure~\ref{fig:genievarsRPA}).
The fractional covariance matrix and correlation matrix for the 1eNp0$\pi$ selection are presented in Figure~\ref{fig:geniematrices} which is estimated to be ~20\% in average and up to 45\% at around 0.2 - 0.4 GeV. Meanwhile, Figure~\ref{fig:geniesystvars} displays the effects of reweighting central value in each universe of an individual parameter of flux.}
%The framework that we are using has limitations on the handling of the different weights that need to be applied to the central value and the universes. As we can only provide one weight to the framework, and we have to correct primarily for the central value, the cross section variations are currently double counting the genie tune weight, and therefore the average distributions of the universes in each genie reweighting parameters do not centered at the central value as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:geniesystvars}. This excursion from the central value resulted in the overestimation of the cross section uncertainty where the uncertainties average around 15\%, and up to 800\% in the lowest neutrino energy bin. 
%The work to fix the handling of the tuning when constructing the covariance matrix is on-going and we will update these set of plots when the fix is committed.}

An additional type of systematic uncertainty that can be included is that related to hadrons interacting strongly with argon nuclei~\cite{bib:reintslides}. These hadronic rescatterings can induce a large momentum transfer in the hadron and thus have an impact in the reconstruction and the selection of events. These uncertainties can be thought of as GEANT4 uncertainties in the cross section of a hadron with argon nuclei. The hadronic reinteraction uncertainties listed in Table~\ref{tab:fluxsyst} are technically readily available to the analysis but have not been investigated.

\section{Sensitivity Estimation \textcolor{green}{Nico}}

\label{sec:Sensitivity2Osc}
The primary scope of the analysis is to be able to learn knew knowledge about the anomalous excess observed by MiniBooNE.
For this reason, the sensitivity to this excess is estimated, as a metric of the power of the analysis.
The model for the signal currently used is the MiniBooNE LEE unfolded signal \cite{bib:sbnfit20437}.

\label{sec:sensitivity}

In its current version, this Tech-Note estimates sensitivities using the 1$e$N$p$ box-cut selection (section~\ref{sec:nueselection:1eNp}). In future iterations the BDT-approach will be used to measure the estimated sensitivity, once this selection has been further developed and validated. The BDT's sensitivity is expected to be larger then that obtained through the box-cut approach.

The primary scope of the analysis is to be able to understand the nature of the anomalous excess observed by MiniBooNE. In particular, MicroBooNE aims to determine whether a potential excess of events is caused by neutrino interactions with electron- or photon-like activity in the final state.
For this reason, the sensitivity to a \nue electron-like excess is estimated, as a metric of the power of the analysis.
The model for the signal currently used is the MB-$\nu_e$ LEE unfolded signal~\cite{C2}.

To construct this signal, the reconstructed energy distribution, under the CCQE hypothesis, of the excess observed by MiniBooNE, is unfolded to a distribution in true neutrino energy.
Scale factors of excess events to the intrinsic \nue flux are then derived, as seen in figure \ref{fig:lee_unfolded_signal}.
This additional flux component is then propagated in the MicroBooNE simulation.

\begin{figure}[]
    \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{Sensitivity/lee_unfolded_signal.png}
    \caption{If the intrinsic \nue flux was the red histogram instead of the predicted blue histogram then the observed excess and MC prediction for the reconstructed energy in MiniBooNE would match.}
    \label{fig:lee_unfolded_signal}
    \end{center}
\end{figure}

It is noteworthy that this method is not a perfect signal, as the cross section model used by MiniBooNE and MicroBooNE are different, implying that the signal, as in the MicroBooNE simulation, will not explain the MiniBooNE LEE.

The method used to estimate the sensitivity follows the standard prescription for a simple hypothesis test.
In fact no parameter is extracted from the data at this stage: the hypothesis of background-only is tested against the \textit{simple} hypothesis of background-plus-signal, with signal being the LEE unfolded signal.
The procedure is described below:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Choice of the observables, typically one or more histograms. In the standard case it will consist of a reconstructed energy spectrum for a \nue selection plus a reconstructed energy spectrum of a \numu selection for the constraint of the systematic uncertainties.
    \item Choice of the test statistic, which is a function of the observables only. It is in fact necessary to choose a variable that condenses all information of the observables in one number. Different choices are described in the following subsection.
    \item Definition of the two hypothesis. $H_0$ is the null hypothesis, where we do not observed any LEE signal, whereas $H_1$ is the hypothesis where we do observe the LEE signal.
    \item Toy-experiments or pseudo-experiments. The expected distributions of the test statistic under the two hypotheses are built by randomly sampling the observables from their expected distributions. In case of the statistical only sensitivities, the bins of the histograms are treated as independent Poisson variables. In case systematic uncertainties are considered, the bins of the histograms are treated as a Multivariate Gaussian distribution, determined by the mean values and by a covariance matrix, which is then convoluted with a Poisson sampling that accounts for the statistical fluctuations.
    \item Once each toy-experiment is performed, and a distribution for the bin contents of the histograms is observed, the discovery significance, i.e. reject $H_0$, can be computed. This is done by computing the value of the test statistic associated to the observation, and then the p-value with respect to the expected distribution of the test statistic under $H_0$.
    \item To compute the expected significance, in the case the LEE is present, we can consider the median value, and an interval which contain 68\% (or 95\%) of the distribution of the test statistic under $H_1$, and compute the p-values with respect to $H_0$.
    \item The p-value is typically converted to the number of sigma of a standard Gaussian that produces the same p-value, as outlined in \cite{bib:cowan}.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Statistics-Only Sensitivities \textcolor{green}{Nico}}
\label{subsec:teststats}

Statistics-only sensitivities are computed using the SBNfit tool~\cite{bib:sbnfit20437} and a separate stand-alone tool that is primarily used to crosscheck and understand SBNfit (Nicolo's).
The SBNfit tool can currently estimate sensitivities using only one test statistic, whereas the other tool is used to estimate the sensitivities with multiple test statistics.

To estimate the sensitivity of the MiniBooNE LEE unfolded signal, SBNfit uses the following $\Delta \chi^2$-like variable as test statistic:
\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:deltachi2}
\Delta\chi^2 = \sum_{i=1}^{N}\left( \frac{(n^i - \mu^i_{H_1})^2}{\mu^i_{H_1}} - \frac{(n^i - \mu^i_{H_0})^2}{\mu^i_{H_0}} \right)
\end{equation}
where $i$ is the index of the bin, $n_i$ is the observed number of entries in that bin, whereas $\mu^i_{H_0, 1}$ is the expected number of entries under the null and alternative hypothesis, respectively.

Using the stand-alone tool we tested the ratio of the likelihoods under the two hypotheses as test statistic.
In fact, as the statistical test involves only simple hypothesis, it can be proven this is the most powerful test, that means the one with the highest purity for any given efficiency.
\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:llrpois}
T_{LLR~Pois} = 2 \sum_{i=1}^{N}\left( \mu^i_{H_1} - \mu^i_{H_0} - n^i\log\left(\mu^i_{H_1} / \mu^i_{H_0}\right) \right)
\end{equation}
where LLR Pois stands for log-likelihood-ratio of the Poisson likelihoods, and the factor of two in front of the expression is just a convention, to make it analogous to the $\chi^2$.

One can see that the $\Delta \chi^2$-like variable is a log-likelihood-ratio, in the Gaussian approximation, and by dropping the term coming from the normalisation factor of the Gaussian formula.

% Nico: I outlined this before
% The procedure to test the hypothesis is as follows:
% \begin{enumerate}
%     \item We first defined two hypothesis. H0 is the null hypothesis where we do not observed LEE signal and H1 is the hypothesis where we do observe the LEE signal. 
%     \item Generate a large number of toy experiments under the null hypothesis. The $\Delta \chi^2 = \chi^2_{H0} - \chi^2_{H1}$ is computed for each toy experiment and this gives the $\Delta \chi^2_{H0}$ distribution.
%     \item We also generate a large number of toy experiments under the LEE hypothesis. The $\Delta \chi^2 = \chi^2_{H0} - \chi^2_{H1}$ is computed for each toy experiment and this gives the $\Delta \chi^2_{H1}$ distribution.
%     \item The quoted sensitivity for the discovery of the LEE is given by the p-value at the median of the $H1$ distribution.
% \end{enumerate}
The statistical-only sensitivity is measured using the result of the box-cut 1$e$N$p$ selection (figure~\ref{fig:1eNp:box:RUN1}). The distribution of the test-statistic computed with SBNFit ($\Delta\chi^2$, eq.~\ref{eqn:deltachi2}) and the stand-alone tool \emph{LLR Poisson} (eq.~\ref{eqn:llrpois}) are shown on the left and right-panel of figure~\ref{fig:1eNp:box:statonlysensitivity}, respectively. The stand-alone tool was also used to validate that, when using the $\Delta\chi^2$ test-statistic, results from SBNFit's statistics-only sensitivity calculation can be fully reproduced.

\subsection{Sensitivities with systematic uncertainties \textcolor{green}{Nico}}
\label{subsec:sensitivity_syst_uncertainty}
Two different studies have been performed to estimate the sensitivity in presence of systematic uncertainties.

The first one is based on SBNfit and consists of two modification to the previous analysis: modifying the $\Delta \chi^2$ test statistic, and sampling according to the systematic uncertainties.
The effect of the systematic uncertainties on the observables can be condensed in the covariance matrix, which is obtained by marginalising over the systematic uncertainties, as seen in \ref{sec:systematics}.

The $\Delta \chi^2$ is modified as follows taking into account the covariance matrix $E_{ij}$, which includes both statistical and systematic uncertainties.
\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:deltachi2_systematic}
\Delta\chi^2 = \sum_{i,j=1}^{N}\left( (n^i - \mu^i_{H_1})E_{i,j}^{-1}(n^j - \mu^j_{H_1}) - (n^i - \mu^i_{H_0})E_{i,j}^{-1}(n^j - \mu^j_{H_0})\right)
\end{equation}
This second test statistic is more optimal in the case systematic uncertainties are present.

Secondly, SBNfit uses the covariance matrix to properly sample from the covariance matrix.
The toy experiments can be generated once the full covariance matrix is in hand. Assuming that the covariance matrix is a symmetric, positive-definite matrix, the procedure to generate these toy experiments is as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item A Cholesky decomposition \cite{bib:cholesky} is performed on the covariance matrix: $$M = LL^{T}$$,
    where $L$ is a lower triangular matrix.
    \item A vector $v$ with length equal to the number of bins as the selection is generated, where each of the $i$ elements of $v$ are drawn from a Gaussian distribution.
    \item A Poisson fluctuated toy data histogram is given by
$$x_{toy} = x_{CV} + Lv.$$
    % \item We follow the same procedure to test the LEE hypothesis as described in the Section~\ref{subsec:teststats}
\end{enumerate}

% \end{figure}
The resulting plot of the test statistic for the 1eNp0$pi$ selection described in \ref{eqn:deltachi2_systematic} before applying any constraint is shown in figure \ref{fig:1eNp:box:statsystsensitivity}. The median sensitivity obtained including flux and cross-section systematic uncertainties is $1.8\sigma$. This calculation is performed without sideband constraints.

\end{center}
\end{figure}

A second and simpler exercise is performed to get a rough understanding of the degradation of the sensitivity due to the presence of systematic uncertainties, using Nicol\`o's tool.
The sampling of toy-experiments is performed by adding, in addition to the statistical bin content fluctuations, a Gaussian sampling independent for each bin with mean equal to the expected value of the bin content and standard deviation set to a fixed fraction of uncertainty. We choose a value of 20\%: the average level of systematic uncertainty seen in the MCC8 \numucc inclusive analysis~\cite{bib:numuCCincl}.
This process is equivalent to sample from a diagonal covariance matrix, with fractional uncertainties is set to the desired value.
Results from this method are shown in figure \ref{fig:sensitivity_function_pot}.

\subsection{How Constraints and Systematics are included in the 1$e$N$p$ Sensitivity Calculation \textcolor{red}{Maya}}
\label{ssec:finalSensitivityCalc}

The multiple selections described in  ~\ref{sec:nueselection}-\ref{sec:numuselection} share the same neutrino flux and cross-section and therefore the measurements between them are highly correlated. We can exploit these correlations to reduce the systematics uncertainties when performing the combined side-by-side fit of the different channel for the sensitivity results. \textcolor{blue}{It is important to point out that the constraint procedure currently applied requires that the $\nu_{\mu} - \nu_e$ correlations exploited (and more generally the correlations between the $\nu_e$ channel and any other sideband) represent the underlying truth correlations between these different event categories. A mis-modeling of these correlations can lead to an incorrect estimation of the expected $\nu_e$ rate and its uncertainties. Ensuring that such correlations are modeled correctly is not a simple task. At a minimum, it requires a robust validation of MicroBooNE's simulation through a detailed studies of data-simulation comparisons in a broad range of variables and phase space.}

The different selections described in Section~\ref{sec:nueselection} provide constraints to different energy range of the 1eNp selection as well as the kinematics and topology. The inclusive $\nu_e$ selection can be used to constrain the high energy $\nu_e$. We explore the prospect of adding the inclusive $\nu_e$ selection to constrain the high energy $\nu_e$. Given the non-orthogonality of this selection to the 1eNp0$\pi$ selection, we still need to explore other variables that can provide orthogonality in order to exercise the constraint. The 1e0p0$\pi$ channel can provide constraint to the less understood proton reconstruction and kinematics. The CC and NC $\pi0$ samples can be utilized to constrain the uncertainties coming from shower. Finally, we can use the $\nu_\mu$ selection to constrain the flux and cross section at low energy $\nu_e$ and Section~\ref{subsec:constraintfromnumu} describes this in more details. \textcolor{blue}{In its current state, the analysis utilizes solely the  $\nu_{\mu}$ channel as a constraint for $\nu_e$ systematics. Constraints employing the \zpsel and $\pi^0$ channels will be implemented in future iterations of this work.}


\subsubsection{Constraint from Muon Neutrinos}
\label{subsec:constraintfromnumu}
Using the measured $\nu_{\mu}$ channel to constrain $\nu_e$ systematics is an approach used in several accelerator-based neutrino oscillation experiments. 
This constraint takes advantage of the high statistics $\nu_{\mu}$ data and modeled correlations between electron and muon neutrino fluxes and cross sections. 
The constraint is exercised through the covariance matrix constructed in the energy spectrum of $\nu_e$ and $\nu_{\mu}$. 
The correlation between the elements in the matrix provides constraint when we perform the combined fits between the two channels. 
This constraint comes from the minimization of the $\chi^2$ when we fit both the 1eNp $\nu_e$ and the inclusive $\nu_{\mu}$ selection to the MiniBooNE unfolded LEE signal. 
Figure~\cite{fig:numuconstraint} displayed the truth-level cross section (genie) and flux correlation matrix between the two channels \textcolor{red}. 

\textit{Note that work on getting the numu constraint channel with the new genie tuned CV is still underway. 
The matrices are shown here to demonstrate the effect of the constraint which will be updated once the new $\nu_{\mu}$ constraint channel is available. 
At the time of the plots creation, the CCQE-related knobs are not included in the systematics, hence the cross section uncertainties are mostly dominated by the resonance uncertainties. 
Therefore, we observed less correlation between the $\nu_e$ and the $\nu_{\mu}$ channels at low $\nu_e$ energy.}

\subsection{Sensitivity to a 3+1 $\nu_s$ oscillation signal \textcolor{green}{Nico}}
In addition to quoting the sensitivity to the MiniBooNE unfolded signal model, sensitivity to a 3+1 $\sim$eV sterile-neutrino oscillation signal is studied. The nature of this analysis, and the strong connection of past short baseline anomalies to sterile neutrino models, makes the investigation of such a hypothesis interesting and relevant for the results' interpretation. While strong tension exists in global fits to 3+1 signals, this model is less dependent on MiniBooNE's detector and neutrino interaction modeling and therefore provides complementary information enriching the analysis as a whole.
The model under study is a simple extension of the standard with one sterile neutrino.
\par The effective oscillation probability \numu $\rightarrow$ \nue is:
\begin{equation}
    P^{osc,~short~baseline}_{\mu \rightarrow e} = \sin^2(2\theta_{e \mu}) \sin^2 \left( 1.27 \Delta m_{14}^2 \frac{L}{E} \right)
\end{equation}
which is characterised by an effective mixing parameter $\sin^2(2\theta_{e \mu})$ and oscillation frequency $\Delta m_{14}^2$.
The same framework is used to perform a simple hypothesis test and compute expected statistical-only sensitivities.
This means that no fit or extraction of these parameters is performed at this stage. 
The parameters value of the best fit to the appearance experiments is chosen, as taken from \cite{bib:oscillation_parameters}.
The parameters are $\sin^2(2\theta_{e \mu}) = 0.00697$ and $\Delta m_{14}^2 = 0.573 \text{eV}^2$.
The contribution from the oscillation to the expected \nue flux is shown in figure \ref{fig:weights_oscillation_prob}.% on the left and right plots, respectively.

The sensitivity is estimated using the $\nu_e$ CC inclusive selection (sec.~\ref{sec:nueselection:inclusive}).
The left plot in figure \ref{fig:oscillation_sensitivity} shows the expected reconstructed shower energy spectrum in the presence of the signal. The blue distribution $H_0$ inclues both $\nu_e$ as well as background events (which can be seen individually in figure~\ref{fig:pre_event_score}).
The right plot shows the distribution of the Poisson LLR test statistic under the null hypothesis (blue) and oscillation-signal hypothesis (orange), with the expected significance to this signal.

\section{Conclusions and Outlook}

\subsection{Remaining Steps in the Analysis}
\par There are several known remaining steps to be completed by the analysis. We list them below, trying to give a timeline for each. 
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{MC Statistics} Larger MC statistics for specific background categories are needed to be able to better train the \npsel BDT as well as obtain a more accurate estimation of expected backgrounds from different background neutrino categories. Initial samples for specific background categories have been generated (with $\times2-8$ the stats from the default BNB simulation, depending on the sample). It is expected that these will be included in the analysis by the Feb. 2020 collaboration meeting. \textcolor{green}{Giuseppe}
    \item \textbf{BDT Selection and Sensitivity} Once larger MC samples are avilable, we plan to finalize the BDT based selections and produce updated sensitivities. This work will be performed by the February meeting. \textcolor{green}{Giuseppe, David, Sophie, Wouter}
    \item \textbf{Common Optical Filter} An optical-based filter rejects MicroBooNE data with less than 20 photo-electrons of prompt light activity in the beam spill. This cut is not applied in simulation. Information for whether simulated events pass this cut is now stored in our analysis NTuples and this cut will be fully incorporated by the Feb. collaboration meeting. This cut has minimal effect on Run 1 analyses (where the \texttt{SliceID} provides a more aggressive cut) but becomes relevant in Run 3 data/simulation comparisons. \textcolor{green}{David}
    \item \textbf{Charge re-calibration} A discrepancy in d$E$/d$x$ measured for both tracks and showers indicates a few-percent mis-calibration. In order to further improve data-simulation agreement. This re-calibration, outlined in DocDB 26438 is being implemented in the analysis code and should be incorporated in the analysis by the February collaboration meeting. \textcolor{green}{Nicolo, David}
    \item \textbf{LLR-PID $e-\gamma$ Separation} The analysis team is exploring applying a log-likelihood based PID for $e-\gamma$ separation, in a similar way to that developed for tracks (see~\ref{subsec:loglikelihoodpid}). The goal is to further improve the rejection power for photons in the $\nu_e$ selections. Preliminary work on this will be reported at the February collaboration meeting but possibly will not be integrated in the full analysis until later in the spring.\textcolor{green}{Nicolo}
    \item \textbf{Detector Systematics} Not all samples are currently available. Those available have been processed, and a preliminary study of their impact on reconstructed variables and efficiencies was presented. Their full inclusion in the sensitivity estimation is however dependent on certain development needed in SBNFit. We expect to also be able to fully include detector systematic uncertainties by February meeting.\textcolor{green}{David, Maya}
    \item \textbf{$\nu_{\mu}$ Constraint Implementation} An upadted $\nu_{\mu}$ selection focused on reconstructing low-energy $\nu_{\mu}$ interactions was developed for this note. This selection, presented in section~\ref{ssec:NuMUCCsel:constr}, is now being used to test and validate the constraint procedu. Result of this work will be ready by the February collaboration meeting.\textcolor{green}{Maya, Ryan}
    \item \textbf{Additional Sideband Constraints} The analysis is well positioned to use the \texttt{SliceID} (sec.~\ref{sec:sliceID}) and inclusive $\nu_{\mu}$ selection (sec.~\ref{ssec:NuMUCCsel:INC}) to perform exclusive final-state measurements with the purpose of constraining particular detector, flux, or neutrino interaction uncertainties. Pursuing these additional sideband measurements will be guided by concerns over the dominant sources of systematic uncertainties identified as the analysis is reviewed. These efforts are likely to occur in the time interval between the Feb. and April collaboration meetings. A first candidate for such a constraint comes from the $\pi^0$ sideband which will be used to control $\pi^0$ production uncertainties.
    \item \textbf{Box Opening Strategy} The contents of this note show generally good data-simulation agreement. As the collaboration moves towards opening the full $10.1E20$ POT for the analysis, this team would like to be able to open two intermediate datasets. First, we ask to be able to explore data-mc agreement on a $5E19$ POT dataset of Run 3 to validate that the changes in detector state have not led to discrepancies in the neutrino analysis. Second, we request to be able to open a significant fraction of the Run 3 dataset filtered through the $\nu_e$ inclusive selection (sec.~\ref{sec:nueselection:inclusive}). In order to preserve blindness to the MB-$\nu_e$ LEE model, we are considering opening up only events which pass a certain energy cut. We believe this cross-check is necessary as it helps validate modeling of $\nu_e$ interactions at higher energies before investigating a potential excess at lower energies.
    %\item MCS fitter for better efficiency for low-energy showers.

The middle panel combines all three planes, leading to a smaller peak at 0 in cases where there are few hits on the collection plane\textcolor{blue}{I don't see the peak at zero}. The plane on the right uses the collection plane but leaves a \SI{1}{\cm} gap, which is beneficial when vertex activity is merged into the electron shower.}

\subsection{$\pi^0$ filter}
\par Figures~\ref{fig:pi0:inputs:shrscore1:RUN1}-\ref{fig:pi0:inputs:dot2:RUN3} show the distribution of reconstructed quantities for inputs to the $\pi^0$ selection. Figures~\ref{fig:pi0:inputs:shrscore1:RUN1}-\ref{fig:pi0:inputs:dot2:RUN1} refer to Run1. Figures~\ref{fig:pi0:inputs:shrscore1:RUN3}-\ref{fig:pi0:inputs:dot2:RUN3} refer to Run3. As a reminder, these comparisons are performed after a 0.7 scaling is applied to CC and NC $\pi^0$ events based on the normalization differences found in the $\pi^0$ mass distributions shown in section~\ref{sec:controls:pi0}.
