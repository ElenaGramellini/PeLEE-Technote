\abstract{The analysis presented in this note uses data from the MicroBooNE Experiment to measure  $\nu_e$ interactions from the Booster Neutrino Beamline using the Pandora reconstruction framework. Our goal is addressing the nature of the anomalous excess of low-energy events with EM activity in the final state as recorded by the MiniBooNE experiment. In this document, we outline the analysis strategy, focusing on the reconstruction and event selections performed, the evaluation of systematics associated to detector, flux, and neutrino-interaction modeling, and the expected sensitivity to the MB-$\nu_e$ LEE model utilizing the available BNB dataset of 10.1$\times 10^{20}$ POT. }

\section{Neutrino Event Reconstruction}

\subsection{Track and Shower Reconstruction \textcolor{green}{Giuseppe}}
\label{sec:tkshreco}
The output of Pandora~\cite{bib:pandoraub} is organized in a hierarchy of reconstructed Particle Flow Particles (``PFParticles''), which describes the particle content in an observed event as a parent-daughter relationship chain. Final state PFParticles are 3D objects matching clusters of hits in at least two different planes.
Pandora classifies PFParticles as track-like or shower-like base on a Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm~\cite{bib:tkshsvm}, producing a score with values between 0 (shower-like) and 1 (track-like).

Pandora processes track-like PFParticles with a sliding linear fit procedure (described in~\cite{bib:pandoraub}) that returns the 3D position and direction at each point along the trajectory (where each point corresponds to a 2D hit). For each point the d$Q$/d$x$ and distance from the track-start are recorded using MicroBooNE's Calorimetry module. This procedure allows to accurately measure d$x$, including small deflections due to the particle's trajectory and SCE offsets, and d$Q$, by incorporating MicroBooNE's full position- and field-dependent relative and absolute charge calibration. \textcolor{blue}{\st{The conversion from d$Q$/d$x$ to d$E$/d$x$ is calculated differently for tracks and showers. For tracks, the conversion is performed by applying the inverse Modified Box recombination model. For showers, both for the calculation of the trunk d$E$/d$x$ as well as the total energy, a fixed recombination correction is applied assuming 2.1 MeV/cm energy loss. In both cases, local variations in the electric field are accounted for.}}
\textcolor{blue}{For tracks, the conversion from d$Q$/d$x$ to d$E$/d$x$ is performed by applying the inverse Modified Box recombination model.}

We evaluate the energy and 3D direction of shower-like PFParticles with the same algorithm used for the $\pi^0$ reconstruction paper~\cite{bib:pi0reco}. The energy reconstruction accounts for various detector effects, including gain and recombination; corrections for reconstruction effects (hit threshold and imperfect clustering) will be described in Sec.~\ref{sec:ereco}. We also fit showers using a Kalman filter-based procedure~\cite{bib:shrtrackfitter} which aims at identifying the main trunk of the shower by rejecting hits that are longitudinally or transversely displaced from it; the output of this fit is a track object so that the calorimetric tools described above become available for showers as well, \textcolor{blue}{the only difference being in the conversion from d$Q$/d$x$ to d$E$/d$x$. For showers, both for the calculation of the trunk d$E$/d$x$ as well as the total energy, a fixed recombination correction is applied assuming 2.1 MeV/cm energy loss. In all cases, local variations in the electric field are accounted for.}

By default, Pandora separates showers and tracks with a cut on the SVM score at 0.5; however, as will be described in later sections, in many cases we choose different cut values, i.e. tighter shower definition for the $\nu_e$ selection and looser for the $\pi^0$ control region.

\par The Efficiency of Pandora's reconstruction on $\nu_e$ interactions is evaluated in figure~\ref{fig:nuereco:eff} as a function of true neutrino energy and shows the efficiency for correctly identifying $\nu_e$s in the event in black, and the efficiency for reconstructing $\nu_e$ interactions with a final-state EM shower in blue. The efficiency has a sharp upturn between 100 and 200 MeV, especially in the case when an EM shower is required, and levels off at 80\% and 60\% respectively for the two curves. 
\par At this stage in the analysis, the good efficiency for reconstructing $\nu_e$ events is offset by the very low signal-to-background for $\nu_e$ events in MicroBooNE's data, a consequence of the very small $\nu_e$ content of the beam. With no additional requirement on the reconstructed neutrino, the purity for $\nu_e$ interactions is 0.12\% (figure~\ref{fig:nuereco:sliceid}). After imposing a requirement of one reconstructed shower, the purity grows by almost an order of magnitude, to 1\% (figure~\ref{fig:nuereco:shower}). The $\nu$ background composition also changes significantly, with $\pi^0$ backgrounds moving from 14\% to 48\% of all backgrounds.

\par The next step in the analysis demands the development of a selection capable of isolating $\nu_e$ interactions rejecting the two order of magnitude larger background rates from $\nu_{\mu}$ neutrinos. This selection will make use of PID and topological information described in the next sections. The strong level of background rejection needed to isolate signal events will inevitably lead to a lower selection efficiency.

\subsection{Particle Identification \textcolor{green}{Nico, reviewed by David}}
% GC: this part is now in the previous subsection
%In the neutrino slice, every PFParticle is reconstructed in three different ways:
%\begin{itemize}
%    \item Track, using the standard Pandora Track reconstruction
%    \item Shower, using the standard Pandora Shower reconstruction (is there any modification on top of this?)
%    \item Track-fitted shower, using a dedicated track fitting tool which aims at identifying the main branch of %the shower and fit it as a track. As a result, all the tools developed for the track become available for the %tracks too. For example, for each track-fitted shower, a recob::track and a anab::calorimetry objects are available.
%\end{itemize}
Particle identification is performed with different tools depending \textcolor{blue}{on whether the particle is selected as a track- or shower-candidate \st{the type of candidate a given PFParticle has been selected as}.
If the PFParticle has been selected as a \st{muon or proton candidate, so as a} track-like object}, the identification is performed using the Calorimetry Likelihood tool, which results in the variable Log Likelihood Ratio PID  (section~\ref{subsec:loglikelihoodpid}).
If the PFParticle has been selected as an electron or photon candidate, the identification is performed using several variables described in \ref{subsec:egammaspearation}.

It is noteworthy that this particle identification consists of one or multiple variables, available for the specific PFParticle, that may or may not depend on \textcolor{blue}{additional information from} the rest of the slice. 
For example, the shower d$E$/d$x$ depends only on the PFParticle itself, whereas the track-shower separation relies also on additional objects identified in the slice.

The value of the cuts applied on these variables depend not only on the general level of efficiency and mis-identification one may want to achieve in distinguishing two kind of particles (electrons from photons, for example), but also on the mixture of backgrounds, which eventually depends on the specific selection the analyser is performing.

\subsubsection{Log Likelihood Ratio Particle ID \textcolor{green}{Nico}}
\label{subsec:loglikelihoodpid}

For track-like particles, the particle identification is performed looking at the profile of the deposited charge per unit length (d$E$/d$x$).
The scope of particle identification is to tell the type of particle a certain track was originated from.
For what concerns this analysis, it has been decided to limit the problem to a binary classification problem, distinguishing protons from muons.
In fact, kaons are produced rarely in neutrino interactions at this energy, whereas pions are very difficult to distinguish from muons, given the very similar mass and the current resolution of the detector.
Additional information, such as possible hadronic reinteractions or Michel electrons, can be powerful to perform particle identification \textcolor{blue}{but is not leveraged in this analysis. \st{No additional information is used in this analysis, as we believe the reconstruction is not precise enough to tag such reinteractions}}.

The expected distribution of the $dE/dx$ is modeled for each particle type and for each plane, as a function of two variables: the residual range ($rr$), and the pitch.
\[ p(dE/dx | \text{type}, \text{plane}, \text{rr}, \text{pitch}) \]
\textcolor{blue}{\st{ The residual range is defined as the length of the track between a given trajectorty point of a track and the point where the track stops}}.
The pitch is the length on which the charge measured on a given wire has been deposited.
\textcolor{blue}{ \st{Given the angle $\gamma$ between the local direction of the track and the direction vector orthogonal to the wires and lying on the wire plane, the pitch is measured as $\text{pitch} = 0.3 cm / \cos(\gamma) $.}}
The expected distribution is modeled for each plane independently, and for the two kinds of particles under study, protons and muons.
Multiple effects enter in the model of this distribution.
First of all, the average d$E$/d$x$ at a given residual range depends on the physical mass, and this can be easily seen by integrating the Bethe-Bloch function for different masses.
Secondly, the fluctuations of the d$E$/d$x$ depends on the pitch.
In fact, these fluctuations are intrinsically stochastic\textcolor{blue}{:\st{, and}} the longer the length over which the charge is averaged, the smaller the fluctuations.
On top of these, detector effects such as recombination, deconvolution of the signal, and hit reconstruction add a non-linear response and additional smearing, which is a complex function of the true deposited charge and of the pitch, for which a closed analytic formula is not available.
For this reason, the expected distribution of $dE/dx$ is built starting from the simulation.
This has the main advantage of \textcolor{blue}{modeling \st{containing}} all of these effects,  \textcolor{blue}{to the best \st{as best}} of our knowledge.
In fact, the performance of the particle identification become more and more optimal, the more accurate the model used for the distribution of $dE/dx$.
The model for $dE/dx$ is built by considering well reconstructed tracks (completeness $>$ 90\%, purity $>$ 90\%), well contained within a fiducial volume, and backtracked to protons and muons.
The binning of the pdf (probability density function) is the following:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $dE/dx$: $[0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5, 5.5, 6, 6.5, 7, 7.5, 8, 9, 10, 12, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50]$ MeV/cm
    \item residual range: $[0., 2, 4, 7, 10, 15, 20, 30, 50, 100, 300, 2000]$ cm
    \item pitch: $[0.3, 0.6, 1, 1.5, 3, 30]$ cm
\end{itemize}
A couple of examples of the pdf are provided in figure \ref{fig:llr_pid_pdf_example}, for two different bins in residual range and pitch.

\begin{figure}[ht] 
\begin{center}

\caption{Comparison of the expected distribution of $dE/dx$ for muons (blue) and protons (orange), for two different bins in residual range and pitch (left and right).}
\label{fig:llr_pid_pdf_example}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

For a given track, the three calorimetry objects, one per plane, are considered.
For each of them, the vectors - one entry per hit - of the $dE/dx$, the residual range, and the pitch are used to compute the likelihood of each particle type.
\[ \mathcal{L}(\text{type} | \text{plane}, dE/dx_{i = 1, ..., N},   \text{rr}_{i = 1, ..., N}, \text{pitch}_{i = 1, ..., N}) = \prod_{i=1}^N p(dE/dx_i | \text{type}, \text{plane}, \text{rr}_i, \text{pitch}_i) \]
where $i=1, ..., N$ is the index that run on the hit number.
The combination of the three planes happens in a straightforward way, by taking the product of the three likelihoods, or summing up the log-likelihoods.
\[ p(dE/dx | \text{type}, \text{plane}, \text{rr}, \text{pitch}) \]
In order to perform the classification task, the likelihood ratio test statistic is chosen:
\[ T(dE/dx, \text{rr}, \text{pitch}) = \mathcal{L}(\text(muon)| dE/dx, \text{rr}, \text{pitch}) /  \mathcal{L}(\text(proton)| dE/dx, \text{rr}, \text{pitch}) \]
An example of the distribution of these variable, normalised between -1 and 1, is given in figure \ref{fig:llr_pid_uvy_example}, for tracks contained in a fiducial volume, and backtracked to muon, proton, or cosmic. \textcolor{blue}{\st{As long as the likelihood is correct, that means the model is correct, this} The likelihood ratio, as defined above, } can be proven to be the most powerful statistical test, i.e. the one with the smallest mis-identification rate for any given value of the efficiency.
Any \textcolor{blue}{mis-modeling \st{imperfection}} in the simulation used to build the \textcolor{blue}{likelihood \st{model}} produces a loss of power, but does not add any systematic uncertainty.
\textcolor{red}{quote example efficiency / separation power?}
\textcolor{red}{why it does not add any systematic uncertainty? if there is a loss of rejection power in data, than the cut efficiency is different in data and MC, so this is a systematic effect.}

\subsubsection{$e$/$\gamma$ Separation \textcolor{green}{David}}
\label{subsec:egammaspearation}
\par Distinguishing electron from photon EM-showers is one of the crucial steps required to perform a measurement of $\nu_e$ interactions in the BNB beam. Photon backgrounds to a $\nu_e$ measurement are largely caused by neutrino interactions with $\pi^0 \rightarrow \gamma\gamma$ in the final state, which dominate the $\nu_e$ event rate by approximately an order of magnitude. Three key features distinguish events with $\pi^0$ induced photon showers from $\nu_e$ interactions: (a) the presence of two final state EM showers. (b) the non-zero conversion distance separating the neutrino interaction vertex from the shower start point, and (c) the calorimetric separation via $dE$/$dx$ due to the overlapping ionization segment of $e^+$/$e^-$ pair-conversions through which most $\gamma$ showers manifest themselves. Figure~\ref{fig:egammasep} shows how, at reconstruction level, each of these features can aid in $e$/$\gamma$ separation. This section describes how each of the items above is utilized in the analysis on a technical level, what performance is obtained, and what challenges (both physics- and reconstruction-driven) are encountered when leveraging these variables.

Distributions are POT-normalized but do not conatain non-$\nu_e$ or non-$\pi^0$ events, nor on/off-beam data distributions.}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

\par \textbf{two-shower requirement} Requiring a single reconstructed shower retains 68\% of $\nu_e$ interactions (with no $\pi^0$ in the final state) while removing 61\% of $\nu_{\mu}$ events with at least one $\pi^0$ in the final state. The fraction of selected $\nu_e$s grows to 79\% when looking below 800 MeV of true energy (the focus of this analysis). Rejection of $\nu_e$s is largely due to events where the electron shower is reconstructed as two separate EM showers, often closely aligned in 3D. Events with final state $\pi^0$s are reconstructed with a single EM shower in the final state because either the second photon escapes the TPC active volume completely (irreducible) or because the second shower is not reconstructed. The dominant causes of this second case are (1) highly-boosted $\pi^0$ decays, in which two aligned photons are merged into one shower and (2) photons which go undetected, often low in energy (below 100 MeV). Additional discriminating variables which aim to recover the reconstruction-related mis-ID of (1) and (2) are utilized in the analysis and presented in Sec.~\ref{sec:nueselection:inputs}.
\par \textbf{track-shower separation} For events where hadronic activity at the neutrino interaction vertex (i.e. final-state protons) is visible, a clear gap between the vertex and the shower start-point can be used to reject $\gamma$ backgrounds. This is a powerful background mitigation tool in the 1$e$N$p$ $\nu_e$ selection. Two factors determine the performance of such a tool: the ability to detect protons and other hadronic activity at the vertex and the accuracy with which the shower start-point is reconstructed. The shower start-point reconstruction accuracy determines the level of background rejection one can obtain, as $\gamma$ showers lead to an exponential conversion-distance distribution. A 1 vs. 5 cm track-shower separation cuts lead to 95\% vs 74\% mis-ID respectively, but causes a drop in selection efficiency for 1$e$N$p$ events from 72\% to 28\%. This is a consequence of the sub-optimal vertex reconstruction accuracy for low-energy $\nu_e$ interactions. In order to enhance the ability to isolate $\nu_e$ events in the 1$e$N$p$ selection through vertex-displacement, different metrics are used to measure the presence of a gap between an electron and proton candidate. These will be described in section~\ref{sec:nueselection:inputs}. It is important to note that this background mitigation strategy is not applicable to single-electron searches, which are an important contribution to $\nu_e$ interactions, especially in the low-energy regime.
\par \textbf{shower d$E$/d$x$} The majority of photons manifest themselves in the TPC through the ionization released by the $e^+$/$e^-$ pair produced via pair-conversion. The electron-positron pair is highly aligned and overlaps on the mm-scale, leading to a doubly-ionizing charge-segment compared to electron showers. To measure this, we use the track fit of the main shower trunk and the calorimetric tools as described in Sec.~\ref{sec:tkshreco}. 
%with a modified version of the MicroBooNE track-fitter~\cite{bib:shrtrackfitter} and for each point along a track the d$Q$/d$x$  and distance from the shower-start are recorded using MicroBooNE's Calorimetry module. This procedure allows to accurately measure d$x$, including small deflections due to the electron's trajectory and SCE offsets, and d$Q$, by incorporating MicroBooNE's full position- and field-dependent relative and absolute charge calibration. From d$Q$/d$x$, d$E$/d$x$ is calculated assuming a fixed recombination correction assuming 2.1 MeV/cm energy loss, but accounting for local variations in the electric field. 
The distinctive 4 MeV/cm population expected for $\gamma$ showers is visible in figure~\ref{fig:egammasep:dedx}. The main limitation to $e$/$\gamma$ separation via d$E$/d$x$ is the large fraction of photons reconstructed with a d$E$/d$x$ of less then 3 MeV/cm (23\% of $\pi^0$ events fall in the 1-3 MeV range). This is due both to mis-reconstructed events, for which the start-point is incorrectly reconstructed by more than one or two cm, and to events where the photon shower's energy loss-profile is not as clearly distinguishable from that of a single electron. While the relative contribution of these two sources is still under determination, the second causes a significant mis-ID rate, and is largely associated to lower-energy $\gamma$ showers for which the production of a highly asymmetric electron-positron pair where one of the electrons is barely visible is more frequent. The impact of shower energy on the measured d$E$/d$x$ for a $\gamma$ shower is shown in figure~\ref{fig:dedxgammas:energy}. Below 100 MeV, where most $\gamma$ showers in the BNB are produced, the reconstructed d$E$/d$x$ is electron-like. The impact of distance from the shower start-point on whether d$E$/d$x$ is reconstructed to be 2 or 4 MeV/cm is also important, as can be seen in figure~\ref{fig:dedxgammas:dist}. This is particularly true for low-energy asymmetric pair-production events, and motivates utilizing 
d$E$/d$x$ information at different distances from the shower start-point for $e$/$\gamma$ separation.

\subsection{Energy Reconstruction \textcolor{green}{Giuseppe + David}}
\label{sec:ereco}
\par Energy reconstruction is performed calorimetrically for EM showers and through a measurement of a track's range for contained muons and protons. For muons multiple Coulomb scattering (MCS) is also used to estimate the muon energy. The energy resolution obtained for different particles is reported in table~\ref{tab:eres}. More information on each particle's energy resolution is reported in figure~\ref{fig:eres:particle} where the 2D reconstructed vs. true energy distribution (in log-scale) is shown on the left, next to a plot of energy resolution vs. true energy on the right. The energy resolution reported here is obtained from a Gaussian plus one-sided exponential fit to the distribution $[E_{\rm reco}-E_{\rm true}] / E_{\rm true}$. The resolution reported refers only to the Gaussian width $\sigma$ extracted in the fit, and therefore does not account for negative tails, which are significant in the case of EM shower energy reconstruction, and described below.


\begin{table}[H]
\centering
  \begin{tabular}{ | c | c |  }
    \hline
    particle & kinetic energy resolution  \\ \hline
    proton & 4\% at 100 MeV 1\% at 200 MeV \\ \hline
    muon (range) & 3\%  \\ \hline
    muon (MCS) & $\frac{4.7\%}{\sqrt{E/{\rm GeV}}} \otimes \frac{2.8\%}{E/{\rm GeV}} \otimes 0.0\%$  \\ \hline
    electron & 15\%  \\
    \hline
    
  \end{tabular}
  \caption{\label{tab:eres} Energy resolution for different particle species.}
 \end{table}
 
 \par For EM showers, the calorimetric energy reconstruction response has a significant non-Gaussian component, as well as a large bias. Both effects are attributable to reconstruction effects associated with under-clustering of charge. The energy bias is found to be 20\% and approximately flat in energy, and motivates a definition of a corrected shower energy, defined as $E_{\rm corrected} = E_{\rm calorimetry} / 0.8$. The non-Gaussian response for EM energy reconstruction can be modeled through a Gaussian plus one-sided exponential distribution. Figure~\ref{fig:eres:elec:binned} shows in different bins of true energy the fractional energy response and a fit to a Gaussian plus one-sided exponential function. The residual energy bias, after the 20\% correction applied, is of order $3-8$\%.

\subsubsection{Neutrino Energy Reconstruction \textcolor{green}{Giuseppe + David}}

\par In this analysis, the energy reconstruction for neutrino interactions is performed through a sum of the visible energy of the various reconstructed final-state particles in the interaction. For $\nu_e$ events the reconstructed energy is defined as:
\begin{equation}
    E_{\rm reco}^{\nu_e} = E_{\rm corrected}^{\rm electron} + \sum_{\rm tracks} E_{\rm range}^{\rm proton}
\end{equation}{}

For contained $\nu_{\mu}$ interactions, the reconstructed energy is defined as:

\begin{equation}
    E_{\rm reco}^{\nu_{\mu}} = E_{\rm range}^{\rm muon} + \sum_{\rm protons} E_{\rm range}^{\rm proton} + 0.105 \; GeV
\end{equation}{}

Figure~\ref{fig:eres:neutrino} shows the comparison between reconstructed energy and truth visible energy, which is defined as the sum of the lepton energy, pion energy (if present), and proton energy (for all protons above 40 MeV of KE). This comparison shows very accurate energy reconstruction for $\nu_{\mu}$ events. For $\nu_e$ interactions, with smearing dominated by the worse energy resolution of electron showers.

\section{Control Samples and Analysis Input Validation}
\label{sec:controls}
\par The selections and analysis described below rely on well understood detector, simulation, calibration, and analysis tools performance. This section is dedicated to evaluating the performance of detector modeling through data-mc comparisons of targeted sidebands. The sidebands developed for this analysis are a high-stats $\pi^0$ selection, and an \emph{anti-BDT} filter which targets the selection of $\nu_e$ like backgrounds. Currently comparisons for the \emph{anti-BDT} filter are not available and will be documented in a future iteration of this note.
\par It is important to note that in addition to detector simulation and reconstruction effects, $\nu$-Ar modeling can impact the level of data-mc agreement in various variables. We will try to point out when this might be the case.
\subsection{$\pi^0$ control sample \textcolor{green}{David}}
\label{sec:controls:pi0}
\par A $\pi^0$ selection has been developed in order to obtain high-stats samples of $\pi^0$ events and $\gamma$ EM showers which can constrain $\pi^0$ production modeling uncertainties as well as validate the analyis' ability to reconstruct and select EM showers.
\par Figure~\ref{fig:pi0:mass} shows the reconstructed $M\gamma\gamma$ for candidate $\pi^0$ events, with a calibrated but uncorrected (i.e. not accounting for biases in shower energy reconstruction caused by the incompleteness in charge clustering) energy reconstruction. Overall there is good data-MC agreement, apart from an apparent normalization difference. To account for this normalization difference we measure a flat scaling factor needed for CC and NC $\pi^0$ events needed to obtain  consitent rate in data and MC. This factor is found to be 72.4\% in Run1 and 72.7\% in Run3. We repeat the exercise applying a tighter $\pi^0$ selection enhancing the $\pi^0$ purity and obtain scaling factors of 70\% for both Run1 and Run3. While this procedure is far from rigorous, it allows us to study detector-related and specifically shower-related variables removing a large normalization difference. \textcolor{red}{A more rigorous data-driven constrain of our $\pi^0$ rate, performed accounting for detector and flux systematics, and considering a broader range of $\pi^0$ modeling, will need to be performed.}

\par After applying a scaling factor of 0.7 to CC and NC $\pi^0$ events in the MC, we show comparisons of shower variables with the goal of assessing data-mc agreement for the $\nu_e$ selection. Figure~\ref{fig:pi0:datamc} shows reconstructed quantities used in the $\nu_e$ analysis for $\pi^0$ candidate events which are useful in validating the rubstness of shower modeling. They include leading and sub-leading shower dE/dx (top), followed by the leading and sub-leading shower conversion distance and shower score. The last row reports the reconstructed shower Moliere angle and track PID score for the longest track in each event. Generally, the data-MC agreement is quite good. For d$E$/d$x$ there appears to be a clear distortion, specifically in the 4 MeV/cm peak associated with photons. \textcolor{red}{A re-calibration of shower d$E$/d$x$ is planned for the analysis, but has not been fully implemented as of now.}

\subsection{Anti-BDT sample \textcolor{green}{David}}
\par An anti-BDT filter was developed with the goal of isolating $\nu_e$ like backgrounds that could help study in detail data-mc agreement for events that are close to, but not in the $\nu_e$ signal region. The filter selects events that pass the $\nu_e$  pre-selection but fail a past iteration of the 1$e$N$p$ BDT, in order to veto and remain blind to signal events. The filter was run on $1.5E20$ POT of Run 3 data with the goal of studying in particular detail data-mc agreement for Run3, which otherwise would be limited to $0.8E19$ POT of open data. Further documentation on the \emph{anti-BDT} filter is available in reference~\ref{bib:antiBDT}. Comparisons of distributions from this filter are to be made available in a subsequent version of this note.

\section{$\nu_e$ Selections}
\label{sec:nueselection}
\par This chapter present the three $\nu_e$ selections which comprise the analysis. The chapter starts with the description of common variables and tools leveraged by all $\nu_e$ selections in section~\ref{sec:nueselection:variables}. Next the \npsel (sec.~\ref{sec:nueselection:1eNp}) and \zpsel (sec.~\ref{sec:nueselection:1e0p}) channel selections are presented, starting with a description of where the two selections branch off~\ref{sec:nueselection:inputs}. Finally, the $\nu_e$ inclusive selection is presented in~\ref{sec:nueselection:inclusive}.

\subsection{Input to \npsel and \zpsel and channel orthogonality \textcolor{green}{David + Sophie} }
\label{sec:nueselection:inputs}

The 1$e$N$p$ and 1$e$0$p$ selections rely on a common pre-selection which requires the presence of at least one reconstructed and contained EM shower (figure~\ref{fig:nue:presel:nshower}) with reconstructed energy above 70 MeV (figure~\ref{fig:nue:presel:shrenergy}). This second cut applies as a Michel-electron veto, as the majority of events which do not pass this cut are associated to cosmic or $\nu_{\mu}$ induced $\mu \rightarrow e$ Michel electrons. The two selections are subsequently split based on whether a proton candidate is (N$p$) or is not (0$p$) found. Reconstructed tracks (track-shower score $> 0.5$) are defined as proton-candidates if they are fully contained,  have a \texttt{trkpid} score $< 0$, and a value of \texttt{tksh\_angle} $> -0.9$. The second condition requires that the track be proton-like according to the PID tool~\ref{subsec:loglikelihoodpid}, while the third excludes tracks reconstructed back-to-back to the electron candidate, generally due to mis-reconstruction. For events with more than one reconstructed track, these requirements are applied on the longest track.

\par The efficiencies of the 1$e$N$p$ and 1$e$0$p$ channels at the point where the selections diverge are shown in figure~\ref{fig:nue:presel:eff}. Efficiencies are presented as a function of true neutrino energy (fig.~\ref{fig:nue:presel:eff:nu}), proton KE (fig.~\ref{fig:nue:presel:eff:proton}), and electron energy (fig.~\ref{fig:nue:presel:eff:elec}). Each plot shows in black the efficiency for the common pre-selection (before a proton requirement is or is not imposed) and is reported relative to all intrinsic $\nu_e$ events. In blue and red respectively are shown the efficiencies for the  1$e$N$p$ and 1$e$0$p$ selections respectively, relative to true N$p$ and 0$p$ events. Shaded histograms in red and blue show the stacked truth-level distributions for N$p$ and 0$p$ events for the variables being plotted. An important observation to make is the fact that at this pre-selection stage the efficiency for 1$e$N$p$ events is significantly lower then that of 1$e$N$p$ events. This is caused by the additional requirement of the presence of a proton-like track in the final state. The strong energy dependence for the efficiency in tagging protons is shown in figure~\ref{fig:nue:presel:eff:proton}. While requiring the presence of a final-state proton lowers the efficiency, this requirement has a significant impact on the selection's ultimate purity.

\subsection{\npsel Channel \textcolor{green}{David + Giuseppe}}
\label{sec:nueselection:1eNp}

The 1$e$N$p$ channel is the most sensitive to the MiniBooNE eLEE signal as it contains a large fraction of the signal events and allows for selection requirements based both on showers and tracks. 
Given the large cosmic background and that $\nu_e$ charge-current interactions are O(1\%) in the BNB, a high-purity selection is needed to achieve a sizeable signal sensitivity; the necessary trade-off is that the final signal efficiency will be low.

The section is organized as follows. We first define a set of minimal requirements ("preselection") to obtain a high statistics sample (dominated by cosmic and neutrino backgrounds) that is used to monitor the data-MC agreement of the selection variables. We then define two alternative selections, respectively based on a simple box-cut approach and on boosted decision trees (BDT); the BDT approach is expected to be the most sensitive, while box-cuts provide a robust reference selection. Finally we compare all presented selections in terms for their signal efficiency and purity.

\subsubsection{Preselection}

At preselection stage we apply the minimum set of requirements so that all selection variables can be defined, plus the containment and a minimum shower energy to reject Michel electrons (Table~\ref{tab:1eNp:presel}).

\begin{table}[h!]
\centering
\setlength{\tabcolsep}{10pt}
\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.25}
 \begin{tabular}{| c | c |} 
 \hline
 Cut goal & Cut definition \\
 \hline\hline
Cosmic rejection & nslice = 1 \\
 \hline
\multirow{2}{*}{Signal~topology} & n\_tracks\_contained $>$ 0 \\
 & n\_showers\_contained $>$ 0 \\
 \hline
Containment & contained\_fraction $>$ 0.9 \\
 \hline
Michel rejection & shr\_energy\_tot\_cali $>$ 0.07 \\
 \hline
 \end{tabular}
 \caption{\label{tab:1eNp:presel} Preselection requirements for the \npsel selection.}
\end{table}

The relative fraction of EXT events at this stage is roughly 25\%, so we can look at all selection variables in data and MC in a neutrino-dominated sample with the open Run1 and Run3 data sets. We typically see very good agreement, which rules out major problems related to POT-scaling, detector modeling, inclusive cross-section. \textcolor{red}{The main exception are dEdx variables that show some tension due to the incomplete calibration (see Sec.~\ref{sec:controls:pi0} for more details).} The full list of plots can be found in Appendix~\ref{sec:datamc:plots}. Figure~\ref{fig:1eNp:prsel} shows the level of agreement for the reconstructed neutrino energy variable.

    \end{subfigure}
\caption{\label{fig:1eNp:prsel}Reconstructed neutrino energy after pre-selection for the \npsel channel.}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Box-cuts}

On top of preselection requirements we define a robust selection based on box cuts targeting high $\nu_e$ purity, especially at lower energy.
In this section cuts are presented in different categories according to the background they primarily suppress; however, to the extent that some variables are effective against multiple backgrounds, the following description should be regarded as a simplification.

First, we aim at rejecting cosmic-induced events by requiring a large distance of the neutrino vertex from clear cosmic tracks and a proton-like track. The latter requirement in particular rejects more than 90\% of the cosmics that pass pre-selection. The next goal is to suppress events from $\nu_\mu$ charged current interactions, so for this purpose we require shower hits to be the dominant in the slice, as well as imposing tight quality requirements on the shower object. They rely on several variables aiming at separating electron or photon showers from single-particle tracks, i.e. shr\_score, shrmoliereavg, trkfit, subcluster. 

At this stage most of the selected events contain neutrino-induced electromagnetic activity. The main background are $\pi^0$ events and we reject them with a series of requirements based on the different topology and energy deposition of electrons and photons. We first require only one shower-like PFParticle in the event, and that its start point is at a short distance from the track start. Then, we require that the energy loss at the start of the electron shower is be compatible with a single MIP. Many possible dEdx variable definitions are possible, and information from all TPC planes can be used. However, due to detector and reconstruction limitations, there is not a single definition that provides a sharp separation between electrons and photons; therefore, in order to obtain a good background rejection without large efficiency losses, we choose to apply a loose MIP cut on two different dEdx definitions (described in Sec.~\ref{sec:nueselection:variables}). The loose MIP requirement enforces that there is at least one hit in the collection plane in the probed range, and that the dEdx is not consistent with two or more MIPs in any plane. Finally, the single shower requirement is reinforced with a 2nd shower veto based on clusters in the collection plane that are not matched to any PFParticle.

The last cut aims at rejecting misreconstructed events and requires that the track and shower are not aligned. For reference, the full list of cuts is in Table~\ref{tab:1eNp:boxcut}.

The resulting reconstructed \nue energy after the BDT selection is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:1eNp:box:RUN1}. Two events are found in the available $4.07E19$ POT dataset from Run1, with an expectation of 2.3 from the simulation. Both events appear to be good $\nu_e$ candidates (consistent with the level of purity expected), and are reconstructed with $\sim 1.1$ GeV of energy

\subsubsection{BDT}

Alternatively to the box cut approach, a selection based on Boosted Decision Tree (BDT) algorithms has been developed. This selection is expected to be the most sensitive to low-energy \nue events since BDTs are able to learn additional information from the data and return a response variable that is highly discriminating between signal and background. 

\textcolor{red}{While the development of the BDT selection is fairly advanced, a few steps are needed before it is finalized. Current limitations are mainly related to the limited size of the samples that are available for training and to the ongoing calibration of the dEdx variables used in the BDT. The limited sample size can lead to overtraining and suboptimal performance, while the missing calibration can induce small data-MC disagreements.} 

In part because of these limitation we deemed safer to consider only events that pass a loose set of cuts (Table~\ref{tab:1eNp:loosecut}) intended to reject events where one or more variables is clearly inconsistent with \nuecc interactions. The loose cuts are applied on top the of the preselection both before the BDT training and before the application of the BDT in the analysis. This selection enhances the relative population of \nuecc in the BNB overlay sample from about 1\% to more than 25\% (Fig.~\ref{fig:1eNp:loosesel}). In the final implementation of the BDT selection the loose selection cuts may be revisited or removed.

Two BDTs are trained separately to reject backgrounds with and without $\pi^0$ in the final state. The same set of training variables is used in the two BDTs, corresponding to the list of variables used in the box-cut selection. The BDT training is able to figure out which variables are most important for each background. Figure~\ref{ffig:1eNp:bdt:var} shows that shower quality variables (e.g. shr\_score, trkfit, subcluster) have higher ranking for the non-$\pi^0$ BDT, while variables such as tksh\_distance and the shower dEdx have higher importance for the $\pi^0$-BDT. It is interesting to note that the most discriminating variable in both cases is shrmoliereavg, since it can be useful to discriminate both muons in $\nu_\mu$ events (low values) and merged showers in $\pi^0$ events (large values).

\subsubsection{Performance of \npsel selections}

Figure~\ref{fig:1eNp:effpur:RUN1} shows the efficiency of the \npsel selections as a function of the neutrino energy and reports the corresponding intrinsic \npsel purity in the range 0.2$<$reco\_e$<$1.0 \si{\GeV}. The efficiency is already low at preselection level, especially for neutrino energies below 0.8 \si{\GeV}. This demonstrates how challenging it is to properly identify and reconstruct such events. The loose cuts then are able to improve the purity by one order of magnitude at the price of a 50\% reduction in efficiency. The BDT (box cut) selection then further improve the purity by a factor 7.4 (6.6) with a $\sim$30\% (50\%) reduction in efficiency. With the full 10.1e20 POT dataset, the expected number of MiniBooNE LEE signal events identified with the box cut selection is about 8, and increase to almost 11 with the BDT selection.

\textcolor{red}{Figures~\ref{fig:1eNp:box:RUN1} and \ref{fig:1eNp:bdt:RUN1} show that the background to the \npsel events is in large fraction constituted by single events with large weight. This due to the relatively small size of the inclusive BNB sample. Note instead the the $\pi^0$ backgrounds are smoother since they come from larger dedicated samples. Additional background samples have been produced by the collaboration and they currently being processed by us. We thus plan to revisit the box cut and BDT selections after such sample will become available and after a residual calibration is applied to the dEdx variables.}

\subsection{1$e$0$p$ Channel \textcolor{red}{Sophie, Ivan}}
\label{sec:nueselection:1e0p}
The 1e0p channel is an important sideband sample that can be used to constrain uncertainties associated with the 1eNp selection.  In particular it can be used to constrain uncertainties associated with low energy protons, such as the modeling of the proton multiplicity and kinematics produced by neutrino interactions and their reconstruction efficiencies.  This sample is very sensitive to the neutrino interaction modeling, which makes it a useful way to constrain these systematics with data.  In MCC8 there were twice as many events in this channel as in MCC9, and half of the low energy neutrinos (below 0.8 GeV), were in this channel.

This sample also contains additional low energy electron neutrinos which can be used as signal in the eLEE search.  This signal is also complementary because it is part of the signal that MiniBooNE measured; their signal was 1eXp0pi, or the sum of the 1eNp0pi and 1e0p0pi samples, so including this sample makes it possible to fully reproduce the event topologies observed by MinibooNE.    

\subsubsection{Tools Unique to 0p Selection}

The 1e0p sample is able to constrain systematic uncertainties in the Np sample because it is fully orthogonal with the Np selection.  This will allow migrations in a simulataneous fit, as described in section XX.  This also makes it possible to recover neutrino events that fail the Np selection cuts.  One of the tools used to do this is shower-track merging.  In some events the shower trunk is mis-reconstructed as a track.  These events are typically discarded immediately in the Np selection, either by a cut on the angle between the track and the shower, or the track PID.  The track-shower merging is a tool designed to recover these events.

In the track-shower merging, the tracks in a neutrino slice are matched with the most energetic shower.  The angle between the track and shower and the distance between both the start and end point of the track and the start point of the shower are evaluated.  The track that best aligns in direction with the shower is selected to merge with the shower.  Then the distance from the start point of the shower to both the start and end point of this track is evaluated.  The smaller distance is stored as merge\_bestdist, which is a measure of the closest distance between the track and the shower. If an event has one contained track and one contained shower, but fails the Np selection cuts at either the shower-track angle or track PID stage, and the merged track is within 2cm of the start point of the shower then the event is recovered in the 1e0p selection.  As of December 20th, this corresponded to a 20\% increase in selected 1e0p events.

This tool could be expanded in the future to re-calculate for de/dx along the new track/shower length, or to re-fit the entire event as a shower.

\subsubsection{Pre-selection}
A basic set of pre-selection cuts are defined for the 1e0p selection.  These require that the selection variables are defined, and all potential 1eNp events, including those included with track-shower merging are included.  The pre-selection also includes a cut on the shower energy to remove decay electrons from cosmic muons.

The 1e0p pre-selection is:
\begin{itemize}
    \item nslice = 1
    \item slpdg = 12
    \item n\_showers\_contained = 1
    \item n\_tracks\_contained == 0 or (n\_tracks\_contained==1 and (tksh\_angle<-0.9 or trkpid > 0.1) and merge\_bestdist<2)
    \item shr\_energy\_tot\_cali $>$ 0.07
\end{itemize}

Using this pre-selection, both box cuts and a BDT selection have been developed for the 1e0p channel.

\subsubsection{Box cut selection}

A box cut selection has been developed to select 1e0p events.  The selection cuts are designed to target the main backgrounds.  The strict fiducial volume from the CC inclusive analysis (cite cc inclusive paper) has been implemented to reduce the backgrounds associated with dirt and single showers from backgrounds entering the FV.   In addition to the CRT cuts there is also a cut on CosmicIP which directly targets removing cosmics.  In order to remove muon neutrino, and non-showering backgrounds there are also cuts on the shower profile and the number of subclusters in the shower.  A second shower search for hits in the Y plane is used to remove events where the second shower of a pi0 may have initially been missed.  dEdx is also used to remove pi0 backgrounds.  Two calculations are used, one which looks at the first 2 cm of the shower, and one which starts the calculation after 1 cm so that any hits from a low energy proton that may have been merged with the shower are not included in the calculation.

The 1e0p box cuts are:

\begin{itemize}
    \item nslice = 1
    \item slpdg = 12
    \item n\_showers\_contained == 1
    \item n\_tracks\_contained == 0 or (n\_tracks\_contained==1 and (tksh\_angle$<$-0.9 or trkpid $>$ 0.1) and merge\_bestdist$<$2)
    \item shr\_energy\_tot\_cali $>$ 0.1
    \item (crtveto!=1) and (\_closestNuCosmicDist $>$ 20.)
    \item (reco\_nu\_vtx\_sce\_x$>$22 and reco\_nu\_vtx\_sce\_x $<$234.35)
    \item (reco\_nu\_vtx\_sce\_y $>$ -75.1 and reco\_nu\_vtx\_sce\_y$<$75.1)
    \item ((reco\_nu\_vtx\_sce\_z$>$35 and reco\_nu\_vtx\_sce\_z$<$665) or (reco\_nu\_vtx\_sce\_z$>$785 and reco\_nu\_vtx\_sce\_z$<$941.8))
    \item shrmoliereavg $>$ 2 and shrmoliereavg $<$ 9
    \item shr\_score $<$ 0.1
    \item CosmicIP $>$ 20.
    \item (trkfit $<$ 0.45 or subcluster $>$ 6)
    \item secondshower\_Y\_nhit$<$25
    \item (shr\_tkfit\_2cm\_dedx\_Y $<$ 4 and shr\_tkfit\_2cm\_dedx\_Y $>$ 0.5)
    \item (shr\_tkfit\_gap10\_dedx\_Y$>$1 and shr\_tkfit\_gap10\_dedx\_Y$<$ 3.5)
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}[H]

\includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{1e0p/reco_e_01162020_RUN3.pdf}
\caption{\label{fig:1e0p:cutbased:RUN3} Box cuts for 1e0p selection, scaled up to full data set 10.1e20 POT.}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

The reconstructed energy distribution after this selection is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:1e0p:cutbased:RUN3}.  Note that this plot uses the new Genie model, but the cuts have not yet been optimized for the new MC.  This selection predicts 9.8 true 1e0p events in the full data set and is 27\% pure in Run 3 for electron neutrinos and the LEE.  This selection will be tuned and the work expanded to include Run 1.

\subsubsection{BDT}

A selection has also been developed by training a BDT for the 1e0p events, using a similar method to the one employed by the 1eNp analysis.  At this stage the BDT has only been trained for Run 3 events, and includes a cut on the CRT before training to remove cosmics.  This work will be expanded to include Run 1.

The BDT is trained on a loose selection of 1e0p events, which includes the pre-cuts as well as several additional requirements that comprise a "loose selection" to focus on identifying electron neutrinos.

The loose selection for the 1e0p selection is:
\begin{itemize}
    \item nslice = 1
    \item slpdg = 12
    \item n\_showers\_contained = 1
    \item n\_tracks\_contained == 0 or (n\_tracks\_contained==1 and (tksh\_angle<-0.9 or trkpid > 0.1) and merge\_bestdist<2)
    \item shr\_energy\_tot\_cali $>$ 0.07
    \item Shr\_tkfit\_2cm\_dedx\_Y$<$4
    \item Shr\_score$<$0.3
    \item cosmicIP$>$20
    \item (crtveto!=1) and (\_closestNuCosmicDist $>$ 20.)
    \item (reco\_nu\_vtx\_sce\_x$>$22 and reco\_nu\_vtx\_sce\_x $<$234.35)
    \item (reco\_nu\_vtx\_sce\_y $>$ -75.1 and reco\_nu\_vtx\_sce\_y$<$75.1)
    \item ((reco\_nu\_vtx\_sce\_z$>$35 and reco\_nu\_vtx\_sce\_z$<$665) or (reco\_nu\_vtx\_sce\_z$>$785 and reco\_nu\_vtx\_sce\_z$<$941.8))
\end{itemize}

Note that even this initial selection is somewhat strict, and comes with a drop in overall electron neutrino efficiency.  This is an initial study of the BDT performance, and it may be possible to loosen these cuts and regain efficiency without compromising the BDT selection performance. 

At this stage a single BDT has been trained for this selection, which tries to separate all backgrounds from electron neutrino signals.  Performance may be improved by using multiple BDTs which are trained for specific background topologies as is done in the 1eNp selection. 

As input the BDT uses for the most part the same variables as the box cuts.  In all cases in the BDT, however, the full three plane information is used, while it was not always found to improve the performance when using box cuts.  More information from the second shower search is also included in the BDT, such as the distance from the vertex to the second shower, and the angle between the second shower and the initial shower. The full list of variables used to train the 0p BDT is: shrmoliererms, shrmoliereavg, shr\_score, CosmicIP, subcluster, secondshower\_(U,V,Y)\_nhit, secondshower\_(U,V,Y)\_vtxdist, secondshower\_(U,V,Y)\_dot, anglediff\_(U,V,Y), shr\_tkfit\_2cm\_dedx\_(U,V,Y), shr\_tkfit\_gap10\_dedx\_(U,V,Y), trkfit, and hits\_ratio.

\section{Systematics \textcolor{red}{Maya, Nicolo, Sebastien}}
\label{sec:systematics}

Our selections are subject to some level of uncertainty, both statistical and systematic. The systematic uncertainties are associated to the level of precision of the model used in the \textcolor{blue}{simulation of neutrino interactions \st{reconstruction}} (GENIE), knowledge of the neutrino beam (flux), and mismodeling of the detector response (detector systematics). These systematic uncertainties can be calculated for many parameters of the models and measured variables that we use to reconstruct our sample

\textcolor{blue}{When treating systematic uncertainties, one wishes to take into account correlations between different bins of the distribution of a given reconstructed variable.} For each uncertainty, a covariance matrix \textcolor{blue}{correlating the variation in the measured number of events between two bins is calculated \st{of its effect on a given distribution is obtained}}. Two approaches are followed to obtain the covariance matrix, depending on the type of uncertainty: unisim or multisim.

Unisim means that a single variation of a given analysis input parameter is performed according to its uncertainty. The difference in the number of selected events between this variation and the central value is taken as the uncertainty in that number of events.

In the multisim procedure, several variations of a given analysis input parameter are performed. These are called universes. These different variations are obtained from a different sampling of the input parameter, which is varied within its uncertainty. This approach allows to preserve correlations in the various bins of the distributions of selected events. The covariance matrix can then be obtained as

\begin{equation}
    E_{ij}^{sys} = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{k}^N (N_i^{CV} - N_i^k)(N_j^{CV} - N_j^k) ,
\end{equation}

where $N$ is the total number of universes, $N_i^k$ is the value in the
$i$-th bin of the $k$-th universe and $N_i^{CV}$ is that of the central value. We utilized the SBNfit framework~\cite{bib:bib:sbnfit20437} to construct the covariance matrices and the associated correlation matrices for our selection.

\subsection{Detector Systematics \textcolor{green}{David}}
Details on MicroBooNE's approach to handling detector systematics can be found in~\cite{bib:detsyssupportnote}. To assess detector systematic uncertainties in the eLEE analysis, the following detector variations samples are used:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Waveform variations in the examined variables ($x$, $yz$, $\theta_{XZ}$, $\theta_{YZ}$, $dE/dx$). Samples are available for the $x$, $yz$, and angular wire-modification variations. These detector variations are constructed by profiling reconstructed hit variables of charge, amplitude and width as a function of the mentioned variables with data-driven samples, and re-scaling the simulation by the difference between data and simulation. By doing this, the samples cover the difference between data and simulation. 
    \item Light response variations to estimate the light yield (LY) simulation uncertainty. Four variations are envisioned: (1) 10\% uniform and (2) 25\% uniform drop in LY to account for mis-modeling of the absolute LY in the detector. These samples are partially available. (3) 120 cm (compared to the simulation's 60 cm) Rayleigh scattering length and (4) 8 meter light attenuation length to account for drift-distance dependent mis-modeling. These samples are currently unavailable.
    \item Unisim for Space Charge Effects uncertainty. Currently not available.
\end{enumerate}
\par Detector systematics samples are generated as \emph{uni-sim} variations, meaning that, for each detector effect, a given MC event is re-simulated once with a change to a detector modeling parameter. This produces a new simulation of the same underlying neutrino interactions, which can be used to measure the impact of the detector effect being studied on efficiencies, reconstructed variables, and event pass-rates.
\par In the context of a sensitivity calculation, detector systematics unisims can be used to calculate a covariance matrix for selected event rates in each bin used in the sensitivity calculation. This covariance is then added to the total uncertainty matrix. The main drawback of this approach is the fact that the excursion in the number of measured events in a bin computed from a single variation is taken as the 1$\sigma$ excursion for the error estimation.
\par Below, simple comparisons of distributions relevant to the analysis under different detector variation samples are shown, but the full inclusion of detector systematics in the sensitivity calculation has not been performed. For calorimetric variables such as electron d$E$/d$x$ and $\pi^0$ mass some clear differences, such as shifts in energy scale, are visible, though contained to within a few percent. These initial comparisons are promising in that they seem to suggest a relatively minor impact to the analysis from detector systematics.

\subsection{Flux Uncertainties \textcolor{green}{Maya}}
The flux \textcolor{blue}{model} and \textcolor{blue}{its} uncertainties for MCC9~\cite{bib:fluxmcc9,bib:fluxtechnote} are largely the same as MCC8~\cite{bib:fluxtechnote}. We use the multisim technique to estimate the flux uncertainties. The various sources of uncertainties are taken as independent and are varied individually around the central value. They are listed in Table~\ref{tab:fluxsyst} along the number of universes considered for each. The fractional covariance matrix and correlation matrix for the 1eNp selection are presented in Figure~\ref{fig:fluxmatrices} which amount to 2\% in flux uncertainties. Meanwhile, Figure~\ref{fig:fluxsystvars} displays the effects of reweighting central value in each universe of an individual parameter of flux.

\subsection{Neutrino Interaction Modeling Uncertainties \textcolor{green}{Maya/Sebastien}}
We use genie event reweighting framework with the standard reweighting parameters, also known as "knobs", to model the neutrino cross section and final states uncertainties. Document~\cite{bib:geniesupportnote} describes the GENIE cross-section model, recommended central-value tune, and the recommended uncertainties for MCC9 analyses. 

The updated Genie central value tune is guided on fits to the T2K data which increase the MA CCQE and scale up the MEC normalization.

A total of 55 sources of uncertainties are considered. The majority of them, 49, are varied in a multisim way around the updated Genie central value tune. Their variations are simultaneous to take into account their correlations. This simultaneous variation is given the name All\_Genie. They are listed in Table~\ref{tab:AllGenie}. The variations of the remaining six sources cover the full range of the parameter values: they are varied from 0 to 1. Table~\ref{tab:geniesyst} lists the uncertainties that are used in the analysis and the number of universes investigated.

\textit{Note on the cross section systematics: The genie systematics is currently still under investigation. 
As mentioned above, the cross sections variations are thrown around the tuned genie central value and therefore already have the tuned central value weight folded in. 
Meanwhile, the default central value has to be multiplied with the genie central value tune weight to update it to the new cv value. 
We have to properly account for the Genie tuned central value that is already folded in into the Genie cross section weights so that the shift between the value in each universe of a variation and 
the central value in a bin is calculated correctly for systematics.
We observed a few number of large weights in the XSecShape\_CCMEC\_Genie knob which is also associated with a large weights for the Genie central value tune. Due to these large weights, the procedure to correct out the Genie tuned central value cause the weights to not be centered around the central value, for example in RPA\_CCQE\_Genie variations (see Figure~\ref{fig:genievarsRPA}).
The fractional covariance matrix and correlation matrix for the 1eNp0$\pi$ selection are presented in Figure~\ref{fig:geniematrices} which is estimated to be ~20\% in average and up to 45\% at around 0.2 - 0.4 GeV. Meanwhile, Figure~\ref{fig:geniesystvars} displays the effects of reweighting central value in each universe of an individual parameter of flux.}
%The framework that we are using has limitations on the handling of the different weights that need to be applied to the central value and the universes. As we can only provide one weight to the framework, and we have to correct primarily for the central value, the cross section variations are currently double counting the genie tune weight, and therefore the average distributions of the universes in each genie reweighting parameters do not centered at the central value as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:geniesystvars}. This excursion from the central value resulted in the overestimation of the cross section uncertainty where the uncertainties average around 15\%, and up to 800\% in the lowest neutrino energy bin. 
%The work to fix the handling of the tuning when constructing the covariance matrix is on-going and we will update these set of plots when the fix is committed.}

\subsection{Hadronic Reinteraction Uncertainties \textcolor{green}{Sebastien}}
An additional type of systematic uncertainty that can be included is that related to hadrons interacting strongly with argon nuclei~\cite{bib:reintslides}. These hadronic rescatterings can induce a large momentum transfer in the hadron and thus have an impact in the reconstruction and the selection of events. These uncertainties can be thought of as GEANT4 uncertainties in the cross section of a hadron with argon nuclei. The hadronic reinteraction uncertainties listed in Table~\ref{tab:fluxsyst} are technically readily available to the analysis but have not been investigated.

\section{Sensitivity Estimation \textcolor{green}{Nico}}

\label{sec:Sensitivity2Osc}
The primary scope of the analysis is to be able to learn knew knowledge about the anomalous excess observed by MiniBooNE.
For this reason, the sensitivity to this excess is estimated, as a metric of the power of the analysis.
The model for the signal currently used is the MiniBooNE LEE unfolded signal \cite{bib:sbnfit20437}.

\label{sec:sensitivity}

\par \textcolor{blue}{In its current version, this Tech-Note estimates sensitivities using the 1$e$N$p$ box-cut selection (section~\ref{sec:nueselection:1eNp}). In future iterations the BDT-approach will be used to measure the estimated sensitivity, once this selection has been further developed and validated. The BDT's sensitivity is expected to be larger then that obtained through the box-cut approach.} 
\par The primary scope of the analysis is to be able to \textcolor{blue}{understand the nature of \st{learn knew knowledge about}} the anomalous excess observed by MiniBooNE. \textcolor{blue}{In particular, MicroBooNE aims to determine whether a potential excess of events is caused by neutrino interactions with electron- or photon-like activity in the final state.}
For this reason, the sensitivity to \textcolor{blue}{a $\nu_e$ electron-like \st{this}} excess is estimated, as a metric of the power of the analysis.
The model for the signal currently used is the MB-$\nu_e$ LEE unfolded signal \cite{bib:sbnfit20437}.

To construct this signal, the reconstructed energy distribution, under the CCQE hypothesis, of the excess observed by MiniBooNE, is unfolded to a distribution in true neutrino energy.
Scale factors \textcolor{blue}{of excess events to \st{for}} the \textcolor{blue}{intrinsic} \nue flux are then derived \textcolor{blue}{\st{, in order to make the BNB flux account for the LEE}}, as seen in figure \ref{fig:lee_unfolded_signal}.
This additional flux \textcolor{blue}{component} is then propagated in the MicroBooNE simulation.

\begin{figure}[]
    \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{Sensitivity/lee_unfolded_signal.png}
    \caption{If the intrinsic \nue flux was the red histogram instead of the predicted blue histogram then the observed excess and MC prediction for the reconstructed energy in MiniBooNE would match.}
    \label{fig:lee_unfolded_signal}
    \end{center}
\end{figure}

It is noteworthy that this method is not a perfect signal, as the cross section model used by MiniBooNE and MicroBooNE are different, implying that the signal, as in the MicroBooNE simulation, will not explain the MiniBooNE LEE.

The method used to estimate the sensitivity follows the standard prescription for a simple hypothesis test.
In fact no parameter is extracted from the data at this stage: the hypothesis of background-only is tested against the \textit{simple} hypothesis of background-plus-signal, with signal being the LEE unfolded signal.
The procedure is described below:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Choice of the observables, typically one or more histograms. In the standard case it will consist of a reconstructed energy spectrum for a \nue selection plus a reconstructed energy spectrum of a \numu selection for the constraint of the systematic uncertainties.
    \item Choice of the test statistic, which is a function of the observables only. It is in fact necessary to choose a variable that condenses all information of the observables in one number. Different choices are described in the following subsection.
    \item Definition of the two hypothesis. $H_0$ is the null hypothesis, where we do not observed any LEE signal, whereas $H_1$ is the hypothesis where we do observe the LEE signal.
    \item Toy-experiments or pseudo-experiments. The expected distributions of the test statistic under the two hypotheses are built by randomly sampling the observables from their expected distributions. In case of the statistical only sensitivities, the bins of the histograms are treated as independent Poisson variables. In case systematic uncertainties are considered, the bins of the histograms are treated as a Multivariate Gaussian distribution, determined by the mean values and by a covariance matrix, which is then convoluted with a Poisson sampling that accounts for the statistical fluctuations.
    \item Once each toy-experiment is performed, and a \textcolor{blue}{distribution for the bin contents \st{value}} of the histograms is observed, the discovery significance, i.e. reject $H_0$, can be computed. This is done by computing the value of the test statistic associated to the observation, and then the p-value with respect to the expected distribution of the test statistic under $H_0$.
    \item To compute the expected significance, in the case the LEE is present, we can consider the median value, and an interval which contain 68\% (or 95\%) of the distribution of the test statistic under $H_1$, and compute the p-values with respect to $H_0$.
    \item The p-value is typically converted to the number of sigma of a standard Gaussian that produces the same p-value, as outlined in \cite{bib:cowan}.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Statistics-Only Sensitivities \textcolor{green}{Nico}}
\label{subsec:teststats}

Statistics-only sensitivities are computed using the SBNfit tool~\cite{bib:sbnfit20437} and a separate stand-alone tool that is primarily used to crosscheck and understand SBNfit (Nicolo's).
The SBNfit tool can currently estimate sensitivities using only one test statistic, whereas the other tool is used to estimate the sensitivities with multiple test statistics.

To estimate the sensitivity of the MiniBooNE LEE unfolded signal, SBNfit uses the following $\Delta \chi^2$-like variable as test statistic:
\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:deltachi2}
\Delta\chi^2 = \sum_{i=1}^{N}\left( \frac{(n^i - \mu^i_{H_1})^2}{\mu^i_{H_1}} - \frac{(n^i - \mu^i_{H_0})^2}{\mu^i_{H_0}} \right)
\end{equation}
where $i$ is the index of the bin, $n_i$ is the observed number of entries in that bin, whereas $\mu^i_{H_0, 1}$ is the expected number of entries under the null and alternative hypothesis, respectively.

Using the stand-alone tool we tested the ratio of the likelihoods under the two hypotheses as test statistic.
In fact, as the statistical test involves only simple hypothesis, it can be proven this is the most powerful test, that means the one with the highest purity for any given efficiency.
\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:llrpois}
T_{LLR~Pois} = 2 \sum_{i=1}^{N}\left( \mu^i_{H_1} - \mu^i_{H_0} - n^i\log\left(\mu^i_{H_1} / \mu^i_{H_0}\right) \right)
\end{equation}
where LLR Pois stands for log-likelihood-ratio of the Poisson likelihoods, and the factor of two in front of the expression is just a convention, to make it analogous to the $\chi^2$.

One can see that the $\Delta \chi^2$-like variable is a log-likelihood-ratio, in the Gaussian approximation, and by dropping the term coming from the normalisation factor of the Gaussian formula.

% Nico: I outlined this before
% The procedure to test the hypothesis is as follows:
% \begin{enumerate}
%     \item We first defined two hypothesis. H0 is the null hypothesis where we do not observed LEE signal and H1 is the hypothesis where we do observe the LEE signal. 
%     \item Generate a large number of toy experiments under the null hypothesis. The $\Delta \chi^2 = \chi^2_{H0} - \chi^2_{H1}$ is computed for each toy experiment and this gives the $\Delta \chi^2_{H0}$ distribution.
%     \item We also generate a large number of toy experiments under the LEE hypothesis. The $\Delta \chi^2 = \chi^2_{H0} - \chi^2_{H1}$ is computed for each toy experiment and this gives the $\Delta \chi^2_{H1}$ distribution.
%     \item The quoted sensitivity for the discovery of the LEE is given by the p-value at the median of the $H1$ distribution.
% \end{enumerate}
\textcolor{blue}{The statistical-only sensitivity is measured using the result of the box-cut 1$e$N$p$ selection (figure~\ref{fig:1eNp:box:RUN1}). The distribution of the test-statistic computed with SBNFit ($\Delta\chi^2$, eq.~\ref{eqn:deltachi2}) and the stand-alone tool \emph{LLR Poisson} (eq.~\ref{eqn:llrpois}) are shown on the left and right-panel of figure~\ref{fig:1eNp:box:statonlysensitivity}, respectively. The stand-alone tool was also used to validate that, when using the $\delta\chi^2$ test-statistic, results from SBNFit's statistics-only sensitivity calculation can be fully reproduced.}

\subsection{Sensitivities with systematic uncertainties \textcolor{green}{Nico}}
\label{subsec:sensitivity_syst_uncertainty}
Two different studies have been performed to estimate the sensitivity in presence of systematic uncertainties.

The first one is based on SBNfit and consists of two modification to the previous analysis: modifying the $\Delta \chi^2$ test statistic, and sampling according to the systematic uncertainties.
The effect of the systematic uncertainties on the observables can be condensed in the covariance matrix, which is obtained by marginalising over the systematic uncertainties, as seen in \ref{sec:systematics}.

The $\Delta \chi^2$ is modified as follows taking into account the covariance matrix $E_{ij}$, which includes both statistical and systematic uncertainties.
\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:deltachi2_systematic}
\Delta\chi^2 = \sum_{i,j=1}^{N}\left( (n^i - \mu^i_{H_1})E_{i,j}^{-1}(n^j - \mu^j_{H_1}) - (n^i - \mu^i_{H_0})E_{i,j}^{-1}(n^j - \mu^j_{H_0})\right)
\end{equation}
This second test statistic is more optimal in the case systematic uncertainties are present.

Secondly, SBNfit uses the covariance matrix to properly sample from the covariance matrix.
The toy experiments can be generated once the full covariance matrix is in hand. The procedure to generate these toy experiments is as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item A Cholesky decomposition \textcolor{red}{(add reference)} is performed on the covariance matrix: $$M = LL*$$,
    where $L$ is a lower triangular matrix.
    \item A vector $v$ is generated, where each of the $i$ elements of $v$ are drawn from a Gaussian distribution with mean 0 and variance 1.
    \item A Poisson fluctuated toy data histogram is given by
$$x_{toy} = x_{CV} + Lv.$$
    % \item We follow the same procedure to test the LEE hypothesis as described in the Section~\ref{subsec:teststats}
\end{enumerate}

The resulting plot of the test statistic for the 1eNp0$pi$ selection described in \ref{eqn:deltachi2_systematic} before applying any constraint is shown in figure \ref{fig:1eNp:box:statsystsensitivity}.

\end{center}
\end{figure}

A second and simpler exercise is performed to get a rough understanding of the degradation of the sensitivity due to the presence of systematic uncertainties, using Nicol\`o's tool.
The same procedure outlined before is repeated by adding a Gaussian sampling, independent for each bin, with mean equal to the expected value of the bin content and standard deviation set to a fixed fraction of uncertainty (e.g. 20\%, which is about the average level of systematic uncertainty seen in the MCC8 \numucc inclusive analysis~\cite{bib:numuCCincl}).
This process is equivalent to sample from a diagonal covariance matrix, with fractional uncertainties is set to the desired value.
Results from this method are shown in figure \ref{fig:sensitivity_function_oot}.

\subsection{How Constraints and Systematics are included in the 1$e$N$p$ Sensitivity Calculation \textcolor{red}{Maya}}
\label{ssec:finalSensitivityCalc}

The multiple selections described in  ~\ref{sec:nueselection}-\ref{sec:numuselection} share the same neutrino flux and cross-section and therefore the measurements between them are highly correlated. We can exploit these correlations to reduce the systematics uncertainties when performing the combined side-by-side fit of the different channel for the sensitivity results. \textcolor{blue}{It is important to point out that the constraint procedure currently applied requires that the $\nu_{\mu} - \nu_e$ correlations exploited (and more generally the correlations between the $\nu_e$ channel and any other sideband) represent the underlying truth correlations between these different event categories. A mis-modeling of these correlations can lead to an incorrect estimation of the expected $\nu_e$ rate and its uncertainties. Ensuring that such correlations are modeled correctly is not a simple task. At a minimum, it requires a robust validation of MicroBooNE's simulation through a detailed studies of data-simulation comparisons in a broad range of variables and phase space.}

The different selections described in Section~\ref{sec:nueselection}-\ref{sec:numuselection} provide constraints to different energy range of the 1eNp selection as well as the kinematics and topology. The inclusive $\nu_e$ selection can be used to constrain the high energy $\nu_e$. We explore the prospect of adding the inclusive $\nu_e$ selection to constrain the high energy $\nu_e$. Given the non-orthogonality of this selection to the 1eNp0$\pi$ selection, we still need to explore other variables that can provide orthogonality in order to exercise the constraint. The 1e0p0$\pi$ channel can provide constraint to the less understood proton reconstruction and kinematics. The CC and NC $\pi0$ samples can be utilized to constrain the uncertainties coming from shower. Finally, we can use the $\nu_\mu$ selection to constrain the flux and cross section at low energy $\nu_e$ and Section~\ref{subsec:constraintfromnumu} describes this in more details. \textcolor{blue}{In its current state, the analysis utilizes solely the  $\nu_{\mu}$ channel as a constraint for $\nu_e$ systematics. Constraints employing the \zpsel and $\pi^0$ channels will be implemented in future iterations of this work.}

\subsubsection{Constraint from Muon Neutrino}
\label{subsec:constraintfromnumu}
Using the measured $\nu_{\mu}$ energy spectrum interactions to constrain $\nu_e$ systematics is a common approach in oscillation experiments. 
This constraint takes advantage of the high statistics $\nu_{\mu}$ data and known correlations between electron and muon neutrino fluxes and cross sections. 
The constraint is exercised through the covariance matrix constructed in the energy spectrum of $\nu_e$ and $\nu_{\mu}$. 
The correlation between the elements in the matrix provides constraint when we perform the combined fits between the two channels. 
This constraint comes from the minimization of the $\chi^2$ when we fit both the 1eNp $\nu_e$ and the inclusive $\nu_{\mu}$ selection to the MiniBooNE unfolded LEE signal. 
Figure~\cite{fig:numuconstraint} displayed the cross section (genie) and flux correlation matrix between the two channels \textcolor{red}{(are these truth-level correlations?)}. 

\textit{Note that work on getting the numu constraint channel with the new genie tuned CV is still underway. 
The matrices are shown here to demonstrate the effect of the constraint which will be updated once the new $\nu_{\mu}$ constraint channel is available. 
At the time of the plots creation, the CCQE-related knobs are not included in the systematics, hence the cross section uncertainties are mostly dominated by the resonance uncertainties. 
Therefore, we observed less correlation between the $\nu_e$ and the $\nu_{\mu}$ channels at low $\nu_e$ energy.}

\subsection{Final Sensitivities \textcolor{green}{Nico} \textcolor{red}{Do we need the final numbers from SBNfit?}}

Using Nicol\`o's tool the expected significance as a function of the collected POT has been computed \ref{fig:sensitivity_function_pot}.
This has been performed using the Poisson LLR test statistic, and including systematic uncertainties as explained in \ref{subsec:sensitivity_syst_uncertainty}.

\subsection{Sensitivity to an oscillation signal \textcolor{green}{Nico}}
<
In addition to the sensitivity to the MiniBooNE unfolded signal, sensitivity to an oscillation signal is quoted.
The model under study is a simple extension of the standard with one sterile neutrino.
The effective oscillation probability \numu $\rightarrow$ \nue is:
\begin{equation}
    P^{osc,~short~baseline}_{\mu \rightarrow e} = \sin^2(2\theta_{e \mu}) \sin^2 \left( 1.27 \Delta m_{14}^2 \frac{L}{E} \right)
\end{equation}
which is characterised by an effective mixing parameter $\sin^2(2\theta_{e \mu})$ and oscillation frequency $\Delta m_{14}^2$.
The same framework is used to perform simple hypothesis test and compute expected statistical-only sensitivities.
This means that no fit or extraction of these parameters is performed at this stage. 
The parameters value of the best fit to the appearance experiments is chosen, as taken from \cite{bib:oscillation_parameters}.
The parameters are $\sin^2(2\theta_{e \mu}) = 0.00697$ and $\Delta m_{14}^2 = 0.573 \text{eV}^2$.
The contribution from the oscillation to the expected \nue flux and the oscillation probability and weights are shown in figure \ref{fig:weights_oscillation_prob} on the left and right plots, respectively.

\caption{An additional sterile neutrino at masses much larger than the ordinary neutrinos would induce an effective muon neutrino to electron neutrino oscillation probability.
The contribution to the flux (left plot) as well as the oscillation probability and weights to go from the \nue intrinsic to the oscillated flux (right plot), are shown for the oscillation parameters values $\sin^2(2\theta_{e \mu}) = 0.00697$ and $\Delta m_{14}^2 = 0.573 \text{eV}^2$.}

The sensitivity is estimated using the \nuecc inclusive selection.
The left plot in figure \ref{fig:oscillation_sensitivity} shows the expected reconstructed shower energy spectrum in the presence of the signal.
The right plot shows the distribution of the Poisson LLR test statistic under the null hypothesis (blue) and oscillation-signal hypothesis (orange), with the expected significance to this signal.

\caption{The contribution of the presence of such a sterile neutrino to the spectrum of the reconstructed energy of the shower chosen as the electron candidate (left plot), is much smaller than the contribution to the flux, as the cross section and the efficiency are smaller at low energy.
The distribution of the test statistic for the null and alternative hypothesis does not show a very relevant significance for these values of the oscillation parameters.}
